This post is aimed at collecting notes around software apprenticeships. 

# What do we mean by software apprenticeships?

The word "Apprenticeship" comes from the Old French aprentiz meaning "someone learning" and the Anglian suffix -scip, meaning "state, condition of being." An appenticeship is when someone is in a state or condition of learning from a "master" in a field. 

While software apprenticeships are relatively uncommon, in several other professions the concept of an apprenticeship is a common (i.e. electricians).

So why software apprenticeships? 

* Experience is valuable and hard to learn through a book  
* Our industry has varying standards, what may be considered an acceptable level and appropriate practices for one organization would be considered sub-par or inappropriate for another  
* Most academic institutions are still not equiping students with the necessary skills to be professional software engineers  

# How do we want people to learn?



People starting out need a mentor. Mentoring takes effort.
