## Purposes

### Emergent Design Outline

- 6 sessions, 45 minutes each with 10 minute retro after each session  
- After each session delete code and then stand up  
- Should have a different partner for each session  

#### Outline of Sessions

1. No Constraints / Understand the problem (Solve Conway's Game of Life)  
2. No method longer than 4 lines   
3. No primitives across method boundaries & no if's
4. Ping Pong with Safe Refactoring 
5. Evil coder 
6. No Constrains / Pair up with original partner  

#### Timings

9:30 - 9:45 	- People Arrive, Setup, Name Tags, Find a partner  
9:45 - 10:30 	- First Session  
10:30 - 10:45 	- Welcome & Introduction (Perfect Practice)  
10:45 - 11:30 	- Second Session  
11:30 - 11:40 	- Retro (Small Circle)  
11:40 - 12:25 	- Third Session  
12:25 - 12:35 	- Retro (Small Circle)  
12:35 - 1:34 	- Lunch
1:35 - 2:20 	- Fourth Session  
2:20 - 2:30 	- Retro (Small Circle) 
2:30 - 3:15	- Fifth Session  
3:15 - 3:25	- Retro (Small Circle) 
3:25 - 4:10	- Sixth Session  
4:10 - 4:20	- Retro of the Day  
4:20 - 4:30	- Closing Retro (Big Circle)  

#### Ideas 

For the first session, delete code before retro, for all other sessions delete code after retro  
6 Sessions   
Print conways law on a4 paper to hand out  
Posters with 4 rules of simple design, 4 stages of naming, game of life examples  

## Session Explanations

### Ping Pong  

Write test first, get the test to pass, refactor safely  

### No method longer than 4 lines

### No primites across method boundaries


### No if's

- No if statments  
- No switch statements  

### Safe Refactorings

### Vanilla (plain old)  

### 1969 (compile twice)
### Ping Pong  
- No primitives across method boundaries  
- Tests for customers first  
- No conditional branching  

(One person writes the test, the other person gets the test to pass while trying to intentionally not solve the problem)
