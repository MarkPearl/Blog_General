## Purposes

### Emergent Design Outline

- 6 sessions, 45 minutes each with 10 minute retro after each session  
- After each session delete code and then stand up  
- Should have a different partner for each session  

#### Outline of Sessions

1. No Constraints / Understand the problem (Solve Conway's Game of Life)  
2. No method longer than 4 lines   
3. No primitives across method boundaries & no if's
4. Ping Pong with Safe Refactoring 
5. Evil coder 
6. No Constrains / Pair up with original partner  

#### Timings for Company Internal Code Retreat

9:45 - 10:30 	- First Session  
10:30 - 10:45 	- Welcome & Introduction (Perfect Practice)  
10:45 - 11:30 	- Second Session  
11:30 - 11:40 	- Retro (Small Circle)  
11:40 - 12:25 	- Third Session  
12:25 - 12:35 	- Retro (Small Circle)  
12:35 - 1:34 	- Lunch

4:10 - 4:20	- Retro of the Day  
4:20 - 4:30	- Closing Retro (Big Circle)  

#### Things to prepare for Code Retreat

On the Day Must Have:  

- Print Conways Game of Life Rules on a4 paper for hand out (at least 1 per person) 
- Print Conways Game of Life Poster (2 or 3 for the wall) 
- Make sure screen / projector that can show a timer that everyone can see
- Buy name labels / name tags + Sharpies to write names
- Bring timer for sessions

Nice to have:  

- Print posters with "4 rules of simple design"
- Print posters wth 4 stages of naming

## Session Explanations

### Ping Pong  

Write test first, get the test to pass, refactor safely  

### No method longer than 4 lines

### No primites across method boundaries


### No if's  

- No if statments  
- No switch statements  

### Safe Refactorings  

### Vanilla (plain old)  

### 1969 (compile twice)  

### Ping Pong    

- No primitives across method boundaries  
- Tests for customers first  
- No conditional branching  

(One person writes the test, the other person gets the test to pass while trying to intentionally not solve the problem)
