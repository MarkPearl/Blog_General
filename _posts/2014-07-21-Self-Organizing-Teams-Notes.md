#### General ####

- Managers should manage via heuristic boundaries not explicit rules (aka command and control)
- Self organisation and ultimately agility comes from the people doing the work deciding on the practices to achieve it.
- People accept responsibility more when given problems to solve over solutions to implement.
- Design against demand, not hierarchy/reporting structures.
- People are far more likely to honour commitments to their peers than their bosses.
- Small safe to fail experiments are the best way to deal with complexity - where the answer is not knowable through analysis
- Retrospectives are the heartbeat of any change initiative.

####  7 Levers for Influencing Evolution ####

1. Selecting External Environment  
2. Defining Performance  
3. Managing Meaning  
4. Choosing People  
5. Reconfiguring the network  
6. Evolving vicarious selection systems  
7. Energizing the system  

##### Selecting External Environment #####

The company's approach to innovation  
Expectations about multitasking and focus  
Culture towards mistakes  

##### Defining Performance #####

What is the companys policy to performance  
Providing Training  
Allow employees to explore wild ideas  
How are individuals rewarded  

##### Managing Meaning #####

Leaders can push messages into the system  
Leaders can keep messages out of the system  
Meaning often comes from the stories, myths and rituals that are repeated  
What the leaders do often gives meaning - vice president counting cars in the parking lot  

##### Choosing People #####

Who is on the team influences how teams self organize?  
Should a team have full control over who is on the team? This should be decided by management, but a team should influence the decision.  

Team size  
Location  
Background  
Experience  
Gender  
Motivation  
Skepticism  

##### Reconfiguring the network #####

Communication paths (formal and informal) can be more important than individuals  
You can introduce or remove flows  

##### Evolving vicarious selection systems #####

Evolution - Variation, Selection, Retention  
Retrospectives  
Trusting the marketplace can take too long  

##### Energizing the system #####

Unless energy is pumped into a system, entropy sets in  
Make sure the group has a "clear, elevating goal" or an igniting purpose
Allow people to attend conferences as rewards  
Brown Bags
Lean Doughnuts
