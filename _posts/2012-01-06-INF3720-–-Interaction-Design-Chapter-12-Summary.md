Summary
The why, what, where, and when of evaluation
The basics…

Why evaluate? Duh if you don’t how will you know it is working for the users.
What to evaluate – Depends on the product, but generally usability, aesthetics, emotional, engaging and motivating qualities.

Evaluation of a working prototype
Refining or maintaining a product

3 main approaches, and can use a combination of any of the three

Usability testing – important, especially in the later stages of the product lifecycle. Analyses how a user interacts with a product, uses questionnaires, observation, etc.
Field studies – done in natural settings with the aim of understanding what people do in their natural environment
