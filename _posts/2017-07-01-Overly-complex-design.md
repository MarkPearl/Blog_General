I've been looking for non-software examples of overly complex design / engineering. Today I came across a gem produced in the motor industry, the [Dodge Stratus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Stratus)

The engineers designing the Dodge Stratus made the brilliant decision to place the car's battery behind the front left wheel of the car. That meant that if you had any issues with the battery, or if you even wanted to check it, you would need to remove the front left wheel of the car and then remove the battery splash shield.

Yes, that's right... you need to remove the wheel.

We are not alone in overly complex or poorly thought out deisng in the software industry...
