#### General Notes ####

Team contracts are meant to help accelerate [Tuckmans stages of group development](http://softskills.markpearl.co.za/Tuckmans-Model/) by providing a social contract that the team can operate around.
This naturally occurs in the "Norming" stage - by creating a team contract the idea is to accelerate towards this stage of team dynamics.
