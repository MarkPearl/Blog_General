In a study by Green & Hevner in 2000 they discovered that innovative software development techniques were better adopted if the people adopting them had a decreased process control in how to use that innovation.

What does this mean?

In a complex task environment, decreases in personal control can result in greater satisfaction. 

They discouraged an "if you want to do X, go ahead and do it - it's totally up to you" arrangement 
Rather encouraged a more organized approach of introducing the innovation. 
The balance is hard, basically you still need to give people the freedom to choose when to do the practice but within certain boundaries.

Avoid mindsets like, "Now that you udnerstand the theory of X, I will let each of your teams decide how best to practice it", this gives the developers too much process control leading to confusion on how best to implement the technique and the risk of different teams using disparate, and maybe conflicting techniques.

Often managers thought they were giving developers desired fleiibility; instead, they were creating a confusion environment for practicing techniques. Some level of consistent organizational standards and procedures for implementing a practice is essential.
