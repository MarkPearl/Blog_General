## Company 1 - where my product delivery team was my first team

I want to share an experience I had as a team lead at a company once.
This was a different company to the one I work at now.
When I joined the company I was very team focussed, my goal was to help my team get to the next level. 
We had ambitious goalsi, we were going to do great things.

Now to give you an idea of my team. There were 7 of us. Two QA's, one BA and the rest Software Engineers
My team members were skillful and passionate about their work.
As part of the wider organisation, we were one team of about 6 teams working on the same product
Each team had their own lead and was roughly the same size as my team.

Early on with my team (about a month in) we had another team contribute to our code base. They did this in a way that irritated me.
We came in one morning and there was this pull request. No context, no upfront communication, just a bunch of work done in our area.
Looking at the pull request, it wasn't very good. Tests weren't great, they clearly didn't understand the context of the code and when we merged it, it broke the build. 

At our daily stand up my team was frustrated and angry. How unprofessional this other team was to make these changes without reaching out to us first. How could they waste our time. I expressed my frustration and dissapointment and promised to have a word with their lead.

I set up some time with the the lead. I didn't know him that well. While we sat two rows apart, up till then we had only had a handful of conversations.
The conversation went kind of alright. I think he apologised although I'm not really sure. I just remember coming out of it thinking not great but alright.

Fast foward a few months later and things had not improved. There was clearly a divide between our teams. Whenever our teams work crossed boundaries there was friction and frustration. My team just didn't trust that team. My relationship with the lead also wasn't great. I was never quite sure where he stood on things or if he was being fully transparent. We spoke sparsely and only when there were issues.

Looking at the wider we had driven this culture of autonomous teams and while the deivery teams were working there were gaps in the wider system. 

For instance, I was never quite sure how defects or bugs got done. My gut feel was that bugs were getting reported by our customers but getting put on a backlog because support couldn't figure out which team was actually meant to do that work. Hiring was fragmented. Teams were definitely looking for different things in people. Career progression was also a mess. It was never clear on how to progress from one role to another. 

I had a team member who was employed as a mid level engineer who had been with the company for about a year. He was good however in our career progression conversations it was clear that he still had some growth areas before being ready to be a senior. I remember one week having a 1:1 with him where he had agreed with me that he wasn't ready to be a senior, only the next day for me to be given a letter informing me of his promotion. I now needed to go back in to meet with him and convince him that he deserved it. This was one of many weird promotion challenges we faced.

Now, why do I share this experience with you? If I look back at that organisation, each team was great at delivering their vertical of the work. We were not good at working as an effective wider system. While there is some accountability on others for that, in hindsight I was also accountable for it. When I joined the organisation I had seen my team as my delivery team. I had focussed on us being effective. What I had realised was that my first team was actually the other team leads and that we were disfunctional, unaligned and ineffective. 

## Company 2 - where 

Fifedoms (we are better than that team)
Systemic issues that nobody ever brought up to resolve cross team
Team vertical issues would get resolved, but challenges that were cross team boundries rarely got addressed
Felt that other teams code, practices and behaviour was never up to scratch
When someone from a different team had a problem, you came to the defense of your team member, you had their back
