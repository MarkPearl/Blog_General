## Chapter 1

* Don't force people to pair, it involves breaking old habits and being more communicative & collaborative than we've been conditioned to be
* When we talk about pairing, we include design and testing in the "programming" part  

## Chapter 2 - 7 Myths of Pair Programming

* Resistance to pair programming comes due to misconceptions from top down (from management) and from bottom up (from engineers)  
* The misconceptions are often reasonable and rational, but incorrect assumptions  
* Pair programming is very intense, have "pair programming hours"
* Some pair programmers say that they feel uncomfortable working alone after getting used to pairing  
* Pair programming works well with most partners, the one partner that people battle with is the "My way or the highway" partner  
* In pairing an expert with a novice, the expert needs to be willing to take on the role  
* Need to transition from getting satisfaction on doing things on our own to satisfaction on the team succeeding  
* Give 'drivers' an opportunity to fix their own spelling or typo mistakes instead of the navigator pointing it out straight away  
* Speaks about the difference between mental flow and block and how pairs are easier to keep mental flow and make breakthroughs with mental blocks  

1. It will double the workload with two doing the work one can do.  
2. I'll never get to work alone.  
3. It will work well only with the right partner.  
4. Pair programming is good for training, but once you know what you are doing it is a waste of time.  
5. I'll never get credit for doing anything. I'll have to share recognition.
6. The navigator finds only syntax mistakes, surely the compiler can do that.  
7. The only time I ever get any real work done is when I'm alone.  

Tom Demarco on flow or "the zone" in Peopleware...

~~~
Flow is a condition of deep, nearly meditative involvement. In this state, there is a gentle sense of euphoria, and one is largely unaware of the passage of time... There is no consciousness of effort; the work just seems to, well, flow... Not all work roles require that you attain a state of flow in order to be productive, but for anyone involved in engineering design, development, writing, or similar tasks, flow is a must. These are high-momentum tasks. It's only when you're in a flow that work goes well.

## Chapter 3 - The Seven Synergistic Behaviors of Pair Programming

1. Pair Pressure, put positive pressure on each person to do their best  
2. Pair Negotiation, arrive at the best solution together  
3. Pair Courage, having a partner gives you courage to do things you wouldn't do on your own  
4. Pair Reviews, you pick up defects earlier and don't miss the obvious  
5. Pair Debugging, problems are resolved through the act of explaining them to another  
6. Pair Learning, knowledge is constantly being passed between partners, from tool usage to programming language rules, to design  
7. Pair Trust,  pairs begin to trust each other  

## Chapter 4 - Overcoming Management Resistance to Pair Programming  

Managers need to know that pairing will help them achieve their objectives  

What's in it for managers:
* I want to complete my projects on time with high-quality code  
* I want to reduce my risk of losing a key person  
* I want my employees to be happy  
* I want to reduce the amount of time it takes to train a new person  
* I want my teams to work well together and to communicate more effectively and efficiently with each other  

## Chapter 5 - Gaining support and acceptance from your peers

Start small, get buy in with small groups and then re-evaluate once you have seen value
Not too much else in this chapter

## Chapter 6 - Transitioning to Pair Programming by Choice

* Mentions a Pair Programming readiness survey

Developers are more satisfied with using software development innovations if:  
* they have increased choice in when to use that innovation  
* they have decreased process control in how to use that innovation
* their manager encouraged them to use the innovative technique
*
