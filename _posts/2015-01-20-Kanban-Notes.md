#### Motivations for Implimenting Kanban ####

- Deferred commitment is desirable - because early commitment is causing excessive re-work and wasted effort  
- There is unnevenness in the flow of work - and we want smooth, even flow  
- The workflow system (and its workers) are overburdened - and we wish to relieve this
