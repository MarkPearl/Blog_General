#### Johanna Rothmans Definition of Coaching ####

Coaching is about offering options and support. Sometimes a mentor for someone can become a coach but they are different things.

#### Joshua's Ideas on Different Coaches ####

- Genie (show the team) (not the best name)  
- Tour Guide (guide/facilitate)  
- Travel Agent (find a guide)  

#### 3 Stages of Coaching ####

- Lead from the front (do what I'm suggesting and see where we are going)  
- Firm hand in the back (walk along beside them encouraging)  
- Coach from behind (course correction)
