* He's upset with me and doesn't know how to talk to me about it...  
* He has bad news he doesn't want to share...  
* I'm an inconvenience to him...  
* I'm not really important to him...  
* I can really trust the commitment's he makes to me...  
* He thinks everything is fine and we don't need to meet, because he's got nothing new to tell me."
