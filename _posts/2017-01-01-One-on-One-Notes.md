> Build as strong, trusted professional relationship with your team members  

Consistently ask for feedback on areas you can improve.

## What is the goal of One on One's

* Build storng trusted relationshipss with your team members  
* Establish deeper connections with your team
* Identify concerns of team members that would not be discovered in a public forum  

## Tips for better one on ones

* Take a few minuts (7 minutes) to review your 1:1 notes from the last 1:1 bring back the memories of the last 1:1  
* Pick up where you left off from the previous 1:1 if there was an intersting conversation  
* Practice going deeper with big picture questions, start with a big picture question

## Big picture questions

* What is holding you back from being the programer you want to be?  
* If you died today, what regrets would you have about your life?  
* What are you looking forward to most about the next ten years?  

If you ask this question and get blank stares, be prepared to share your own experiences and thoughts on how this applies to you.

## What do people think if you cancel a 1 on 1?

* He's upset with me and doesn't know how to talk to me about it...  
* He has bad news he doesn't want to share...  
* I'm an inconvenience to him...  
* I'm not really important to him...  
* I can really trust the commitment's he makes to me...  
* He thinks everything is fine and we don't need to meet, because he's got nothing new to tell me."
