I recently came across a tweet on tips managers have learned. It resonated with me enough to add to my blog...

> "the improv rule": never say no, instead, say "yes, and here's what it will cost" (which may include dropping other things). Generally I reserve "no" for things that violate my valuesâ€”"not for any price" (implicitly, the price is my continued employment)  

Most things are up for discussion. Most things are trade offs. Next conversation you go into try and apply this.
