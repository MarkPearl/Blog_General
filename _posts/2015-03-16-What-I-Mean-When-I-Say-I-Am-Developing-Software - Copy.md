### What Software Developers Do ###

I recently had a discussion where the comment was made that a group of software developers didn't have time to do any **real work** because they were busy in a retrospective. I'm concerned that a common perception by business people is that developing software involves 95% typing - this is a misconception. Good software developers do so much more.
