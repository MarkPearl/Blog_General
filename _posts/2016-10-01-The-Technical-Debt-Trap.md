These notes are based on [Doc Norton's](https://twitter.com/DocOnDev) talk on "[The Technical Debt Trap](https://vimeo.com/97507576)" done at NDC 2014.

#### Overview

Technical Debt has become a catch-all phrase for any code that needs to be re-worked. Much like Refactoring has become a catch-all phrase for any activity that involves changing code. These fundamental misunderstandings and comfortable yet mis-applied metaphors have resulted in a plethora of poor decisions. 

- What is technical debt?   
- What is not technical debt?   
- Why should we care?   
- What is the cost of misunderstanding?   
- What do we do about it?   

Doc discusses the origins of the metaphor, what it means today, and how we properly identify and manage technical debt.

#### Where did the term Technical Debt originate from?

Ward Cunningham coined the phrase "Technical Debt". The first written record that Doc Norton could find on this was a paper from [OOPSLA '92](http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla-history/)

> Shipping first time code is like going into debt, a little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite - Ward Cunningham

Ward Cunningham used the metaphor 'debt' was that before the OOPSLA conference he had used almost the same words in an email he sent to a client who was in the financial industry. He was trying to explain to his client why the team needed to go back and redo work.

> The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid. Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as interest on that debt - Ward Cunninga

#### Technical Debt is Good

- It is a strategic design decision  
- Indication of learning  

There are two ways we can incur debt,

1) Intentionally (it makes strategic sense)
2) After the fact (here be danger)  

Metaphors are analogies of the thing, Technical Debt is a Metaphor. 
The challenge we have with metaphors is we confuse them and begin to act as if the metaphor is the actual thing we are referring to.
Metaphors can go wrong, over the course of time because we called Technical Debt, we started talking more and more about debt, not the thing we were comparing it to.
