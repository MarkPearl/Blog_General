These notes are based on [Doc Norton's](https://twitter.com/DocOnDev) talk on "[The Technical Debt Trap](https://vimeo.com/97507576)" done at NDC 2014.

#### Intro

Technical Debt has become a catch-all phrase for any code that needs to be re-worked. Much like Refactoring has become a catch-all phrase for any activity that involves changing code. These fundamental misunderstandings and comfortable yet mis-applied metaphors have resulted in a plethora of poor decisions. 

- What is technical debt?   
- What is not technical debt?   
- Why should we care?   
- What is the cost of misunderstanding?   
- What do we do about it?   

Doc discusses the origins of the metaphor, what it means today, and how we properly identify and manage technical debt.
