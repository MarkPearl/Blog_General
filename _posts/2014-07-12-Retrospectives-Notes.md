### What are we trying to achieve from a retrospective?

#### Implement interative and incremental improvement.  

When a team is in a good place socially, I see the primary purpose of the retrospective to:  

- Review the success or value of the improvements they set out from the previous retro 
- Identify the one or two small improvements (or experiments) that they can do in the next period  

**To implement incremental iterative improvement you need to meet at a regular cadence. Meeting sporadically defeats the purpose of incremental improvement**  

#### Recognize we are humans  

When a team is not in a good place socially, I see the primary purpose of retrospective to:  

- Vent, discuss, bring up issues in a safe environment 
- Blow off some steam  
- Draw closer together as people  
- Laugh

### General Format of Normal Retrospective  

- Ice Breaker / Change Mindset   
- Review of Previous Retrospective Goals  
- Main Activity  
- Confirm goals to be achieved by next retro  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Ice Breaker 

I use the ice breaker to help the team make a mental shift from immediate work to taking a step back and looking at how we are working together.

#### Be strategic about your ice breaker  

Don't just do an ice breaker for the sake of an ice breaker. Be strategic about what your ice breaker is. An ice breaker is a great way to get people to get to know each other better. 

- Are there any long term objectives that the team is trying to develop?  
- Are there activities we can do that help team members know other team members better?  

#### Example ice breaker activities  

- Fizz Buzz Group Number Game (also known as Ping Pong)
- Organize seating based on distance that one was born from the current location

### Review of Previous Retrospective Goals

### Main Acitivity

#### Assesing where we are 

##### Example Main Activities 

- Future Backwards Exercise

Things learns from the exercise:  

1. There is value in doing this with multiple sub groups and then reporting back to the main group. Sometimes you find one groups idea of heaven is another's idea of hell. That's interesting.
2. It's mostly a tool to stimulate sense making and dialog, not an end in itself - so make a lot of space for that.
3. On a technical key point, make sure that the heaven and hell paths link back to a previous point in time, not current state. We've seen a team completely unblock themselves by mentally going back to a point in time and carrying on from there, rather than being blocked by the current state, and that was a magical moment for them.
