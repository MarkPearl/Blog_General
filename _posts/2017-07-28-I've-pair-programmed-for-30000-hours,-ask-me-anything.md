These notes are based off the talk [I've pair programmed for 30 000 hours, ask me anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCDfBioUgts)  

General Q&A on pair programming:  

Getting started pairing for the very first time:  
* Be honest that you have never paired for the first time  
* Set's a tone of both of you being extra mindful of pairing etiquette (see that they are stuck, asking to help drive)  
* If you are using TDD, it goes hand in had with pairing, especially ping pong pairing
* Related to this is, what do you do if someone is driving too much? Asking to do ping pong pairing may rebalance the pair  

When do you switch pairs, how do you minamize context switching?
* I encourage you swapping pairs, but it can be painful because you have just made progress and then you have to switch  
* Having a rule like switching every day is more like a guideline instead of a hard rule (ask if there are any pairs that need to stick in your daily standup)  
* When ramping up new developers you will often have the new developer stay in a pair so they get the whole architecture  
* I've definitely seen it where pairs stick for days on end, that's usually when things have gotten out of control and should be swapped out  
* We don't let people to pair with anyone they like for as long as they like  

If you are switching every day, how do you track who is working on what  
* Some tools have support for this, i.e. pivotal tracker  
* You can do things in your git commit that you can attribute to multiple people (git duet, or git pair)  
* Some organizations it is very important for them that they track who is working on what for how long... we don't do that...
