#### Summary ####

Pace Pace Lead is a technique for change. It is originates as a NLP concept. It can be interpreted in many different ways but is a way for getting change to happen.

#### Explaining the concept ####

Marry your pace to the group, then gradually take them along with you so that they will begin to increase or decrease their pace to match yours.  

It is natural that human's mimic each other - there is an innate desire on all of us to mirror the behavior of those around us. Often we call this rhythm. Pace Pace Lead attempts to leverage this.

If for instance you try to introduce change and you do not match your initial 'pace' with that of the group and there is to much of a differential between you and group you risk loosing them.

#### What you need to make it work ####

You need 3 things to achieve Pace Pace Lead:

1) An outcome you want to get the team to  
2) An ability to engage with the team  
3) An understanding of the core concept to begin pace pace lead  

#### Benefits of Approach ####

I can see how this approach is non-confrontational and can help get buying to change. Having 'walked' in someone's boots for a day gives you a lot more context to their reality. It also potentially gives you credibility as you can say you know where they are coming from.

#### Potential Pitfalls ####

A potential pitfall is that you as a change agent starts mimicking the group and they begin to 'lead' you in which case you negate or dampen any change you are trying to achieve.
