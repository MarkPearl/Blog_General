#### Summary ####

Pace Pace Lead is a technique for change. It is a NLP concept.

#### Explaining the concept ####

Marry your pace to the group, then gradually take them along with you so that they will begin to increase or decrease their pace to match yours.  

It is natural that human's mimic each other - there is an inate desire on all of us to mirror the behavior of those around us. Pace Pace Lead attempts to leverage this.

If for instance you try to introduce change and you do not match your initial 'pace' with that of the group and there is to much of a differential between you and and group you risk loosing them.

#### Benefits of Approach ####

I can see how this approach is non-confrontational and can help get buying to change. Having 'walked' in someone's boots for a day gives you a lot more context to their reality. It also potentially gives you credibility as you can say you know where they are coming from.

#### Potential Pitfalls ####

A potential pitfall is that you as a change agent starts mimicing the group and they begin to 'lead' you in which case you negate or dampen any change you are trying to achieve.
