What a let down.

I've been wanting this book for a while, but when I finally bought it and read it, it wasn't what I was expecting.

Let me explain. What I was expecting was a how to guide on consulting. What I got was a book full of anecdotes and "laws" - in fact, most of the book is written in the "Law of this" or "Law of that" format. Now, don't get me wrong, I like a few catchy laws to help me remember ideas - but when you need 3 pages at the end of the book to list just the titles of all the laws covered - it's too many.

It wasn't all bad. What I did enjoy...

- Section on pricing and what to change (pg 181-192)
- Section on how to be trusted (pg 192-204)
- Points of a powerful consultant (pg 118-119)
- No difference + no difference + no difference = clear difference (pg 131)

I also found it had a really good outline of addiction recovery  
  
1) Remember a lapse does not have to mean a relapse  
2) Resist negative thoughts  
3) Ask what happened, plan a strategy for next time  
4) Return to controlled behaviour immediately  
5) Talk to someone supportive  
6) Remember that you are making lifelong change. Look at the progress you've made.
