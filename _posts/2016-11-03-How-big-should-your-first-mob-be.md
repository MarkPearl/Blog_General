How big should your first mob be? Unfortunately there is no one right size mob - mobs are made up of people, dfferent people bring different things to the mob. 

While starting off small and growing the size of the mob as people in your team gain experience in mob programming is often the best approach, a small mob of people who have no experience with mob programming may not as good as a larger mob that has experienced mob programmers. Here are some things to keep a look out for.

## Too large 

Whenever a mob starts, your will see some social 'storming' (if you are not familiar with [Tuckmans stages of group development](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/Tuckmans-Model), it worth reading up on). If you are not able to get past the storming, it can kill the future of mob programming for your team.

Fundamentally, large mobs have more storming because there are more people. When starting, avoid a large initial mob - you are asking for trouble. How large is large? I've found as soon as your start going over 5 people in a mob you see significantly more storming.

## Too small 

If your mob is too small, you will battle to get momentum. There are different dynamics when two people program together (pair programming) compared to 'more' than two people. 

## Just right

You want to start off small
