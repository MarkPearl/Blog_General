For those out there that are interested… I am now one of the hosts of the Driven2Distraction podcast. Being a fan of podcasts like .Net Rocks and Hanselminutes for years now, I have always wanted to be involved in the recording of a podcast and now that time has finally come.

What makes the Driven2Distraction podcast different from all the others out there is its uniquely South African flair. It’s focus is towards Software Development in the Southern Africa – and has a mix of “what happening locally” episodes as well as proper “interview style” episodes of local developers and visitors from overseas.
