When I originally read this book I did a review saying it was a light weight read and that it was good for an introduction of the purpose of Agile Retrospectives. 

I need to take that back. Like most of the pragmatic series this book is deceptively simple - but the concepts run deep. I have referenced this book many times in the last two years with several different teams. Getting retrospectives right is a challenge that every team faces and this book will help you on the road to getting real value from retrospectives.

Probably the most useful part of the book is the listing of various activities one can do during a retrospective but understanding the why of retrospectives is just as valuable.
