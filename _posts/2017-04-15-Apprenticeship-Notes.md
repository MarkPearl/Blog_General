Apprenticeship is a long term investment 

# Difference between Intership, Graduate Programs & Apprenticeship

* Internship is like dating, just cause you are going on a date with someone doesn't mean you will marry them.

# Structured vs. Organic Curriculum

# Mindset of Apprenticeship

* Apprentices should really want to become software developers, they shouldn't be doing this to 'try' out coding  
* Apprentices are paid lower than normal industry wages, they are taking a financial hit to have a long term investment in developing skills  

# Length of Apprenticeships

* Question to ask at end, would you hire them?

# Qualities of Mentors

* Comfortable pairing / working collaboratively with people (doesn't slow them down so much when mentoring)

# Expecations of Time with Apprentice

* First 2-3 weeks intense time spent with apprentice  
* Weekly checkin with mentor after that
* Apprentices should pair or work collaboratively BUT have time to intentionally learn on their own  
* Apprentice should have an opportunity to pair, be in the trenches, add value to the team  
* Weekly lunch and learns, apprentices should attend these, impart concepts that aren't learn't directly through pairing
