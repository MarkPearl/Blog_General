I read this recently and it really resonated with me.

* Admit human failings  
* Recognize the need for other people  
* See the emptiness of a life compulsively controlled by the need for admiration and achievement  
* Discover the ability to lead an orginary life - one with real joys, sorrows, successes, and disapointments  
* Rid yourself of the desire for immediate perfection in yourself and others  
* Encourage connection, expansion, and playfulness. It's more rewarding than being private and secretive
