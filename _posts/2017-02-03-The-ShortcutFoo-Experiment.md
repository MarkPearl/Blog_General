Over the last 2 months I tried an experiment in my team to improve our muscle memory on keyboard shortcuts. The motivation for this was my belief that being able to navigate one's development IDE's / tools without using a mouse leads to more rapid development experience. 

Two years ago I invested personal time to learn the shortcuts of my IDE (which was Visual Studio with Resharper at the time) and in doing so discovered a ton of useful features that I was not aware of up till then. In my team we have great developers and many of them have not yet invested the time to "commit to muscle memory" the keyboard shortcuts of our current tools.

# So, how did the experiment go?

The original experiment was in a challenge form - I called it the [ShortCutFoo Challenge](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/ShortcutFoo-Challenge)
