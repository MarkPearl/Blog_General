title: The ShortcutFoo Challenge Feedback

Over the last 2 months we tried an experiment in my team to improve our muscle memory on keyboard shortcuts. The motivation for this was my belief that being able to navigate one's development IDE's / tools without using a mouse leads to a more fluid development experience and helps you discover functionality that you IDE has that you are not aware of.

Two years ago I invested personal time to learn the shortcuts of my IDE (which was Visual Studio with Resharper at the time) and in doing so discovered a ton of useful features that I was not aware of up till then. In my team we have great developers and many of them have not yet invested the time to "commit to muscle memory" the keyboard shortcuts of our current tools.

# So, how did the experiment go?

The original experiment was in a challenge form - I called it the [ShortCutFoo Challenge](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/ShortcutFoo-Challenge). The idea was for people to practice during the week and then challenge each other on the Friday. The first Friday nobody was ready to challenge each other - nobody had spent time learning shortcuts.

In one on ones I encouraged people to spend ten minutes learning shortcuts each day, the following week one person had spent time actively learning shortcuts - everyone else still refused to participate in challenges because they had not spent enough time on shortcuts.

Also, the challenge experience in ShortcutFoo was buggy, we needed to open the browser in "incognito mode" to be able to "fight a friend". I really like the idea of "fight a friend", however it still needs substantial work to make it more enjoyable.

A potential business model I would suggest to ShortcutFoo is to make their "Fight a friend" feature free, and use that as a mechanism to encourage people to sign up to the paid service - just an idea.

Over the weeks different people began to do shortcuts, although at different levels (in ShortcutFoo you have different stages) - this meant that unless people challenging each other agreed to challenge at the right level it would be incredibly hard for someone on a lower level to beat someone on a higher level.

# Net result

Ultimately one member of the team really enjoyed ShortcutFoo and completed the challenges, however there is still work in moving them applying this in the actual editor.
Other members of the team dabbled with it but really didn't really get into it as much as I would have liked. In speaking to them, reasons were that we were learning Webstorm shortcuts, when at the time we moved on to C# work (which meant we were working in VS).

I think giving people an opportunity to learn shortcuts as individuals is a good idea, but to get a team to learn would be hard unless we had dedicated time during the day for the whole team to practice (which just feels to much like school).
