title: The ShortcutFoo Challenge Feedback from Experiement

Over the last 2 months I tried an experiment in my team to improve our muscle memory on keyboard shortcuts. The motivation for this was my belief that being able to navigate one's development IDE's / tools without using a mouse leads to more rapid development experience. 

While in my team we have great developers, many of them have not invested the time to "learn" the keyboard shortcuts. Two years ago I invested personal time to learn the shortcuts of my IDE (which was Visual Studio with Resharper at the time) and in doing so discovered a ton of useful features that I was not aware of up till then.

So, how did the experiment go?

The original experiment was in a challenge form - I called it the [ShortCutFoo Challenge](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/ShortcutFoo-Challenge)
