For those who haven't heard yet, this year my family and I will be going through some big changes. This week I received confirmation from New Zealand immigration services that my work visa has been approved. Early next month I will be joining MYOB in their Auckland offices to work with fellow South African Martin Cronje in creating some great software. Moving to the other side of the world with a young family is no small decision - it's been emotionally a roller coaster ride - the hardest part the realization that we will be leaving family and friends behind - however there is also the excitement of going to a new place and starting a new chapter in our lives.

Today I would like to go over some of the things I've been involved with for the last few years. Why I started them and what I hope their future will be.

#### Maxima Software ####

In 2001 I started a small software company creating manufacturing software for the kitchen industry - we called the company Maxima Software. At the time I was young and naive with aspirations of making my millions. This month I resigned as managing director of Maxima and sold my shares in Maxima bringing to an end a 15 year involvement with the company. Did Maxima achieve what I wanted it to achieve? Well, I never made my millions from it, but I did learn a bunch of great lessons. Without Maxima I wouldn't have had the opportunity to take a 2 year sabatical to serve as a fulltime missionry for the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints](https://www.lds.org) - an experience that had a major impact on my life, who I married, my children and what I value.
