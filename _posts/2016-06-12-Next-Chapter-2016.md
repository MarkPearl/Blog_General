#### We're moving ####

For those who haven't heard yet, this year my family and I will be going through some big changes. This week I received confirmation from New Zealand immigration services that my work visa has been approved. Early next month I will be joining MYOB in their Auckland offices to work with fellow South African Martin Cronje as well as a bunch of other great people.

Moving to the other side of the world with a young family is no small decision, it's been an emotional roller coaster ride. The hardest part of the move is the realization that we will be leaving family and friends we love behind - some of whom we may not see for a long time.  

While we are sad to go, we are also excited. Having spent a brief time visiting New Zealand, we are looking forward to raising a family there. New Zealand has it's own set of challenges and opportunities - but this post is not going to be about that. Today I would like write about some of the things I started that I have already or will soon be saying goodbye to. 

#### Maxima Software (2001 - 2016) ####

In 2001 I started a small software company creating manufacturing software for the kitchen industry - we called the company [Maxima Software](http://www.maximasoftware.co.za/). At the time I was young and naive with aspirations of making my millions. This month I stepped down as managing director of Maxima and sold my remaining shares in the company bringing to an end a 15 year involvement. 

Did Maxima achieve what I wanted it to achieve? Well, I never made my millions from it if that's what you are wondering - I did however have a bunch of experiences that have made me a better person. 

Without Maxima I wouldn't have had the opportunity to fund a 2 year sabatical to serve as a fulltime missionry for the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints](https://www.lds.org) - an experience that has had a major impact on my life, who I married, my children, education and what I value. If you are interested in finding out more about my experiences as a missionary, I would recommend you watch our [SACTM videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlplFqcQps0kZ9VmvGtDHRRkPXObGbQyq) - it gives you a glimpse into what the day and a life of a LDS missionary is like.  

One of the valuable experiences I had at Maxima was learning the end to end lifecycle of a software product. From conception to development to marketing to supporting - because of the size of the company I had to be involved in every aspect. Maxima has taught me some of the principles of the business of software that I hope to leverage going forward.

Another great experience I had with Maxima was the opportunity to serve for two years on the gauteng board for the [Kitchen Specialist Association](http://www.ksa.co.za/). While on the board I got to see how some of South Africa's kitchen industry leaders think - working with directors and representatives of Easy Life Kitchens, Sonae, PG Bison, Show Cupboards, etc. Many of the lessons I learn't from being on the board of the gauteng KSA bled through into how we structured the [DeveloperUG](www.developerug.org.za).

At Maxima I also had the opportunity to work with some great people. The first fulltime software developer that Maxima hired (barring myself) was Brendon Page - I had the pleasure of working with Brendon for ten years before he eventually moved on and I still enjoy touching base with him. My biggest take home from Brendon was his passion for creating software and his love of sharing that knowledge with others. He is a true talent.

A couple of years after working with Brendon, his brother, Jayd, joined Maxima as a software developer. Jayd is the polar opposite to Brendon in so many ways, but is also just as talented a software developer. My biggest take home from Jayd is his sincerity in seeing people as people first. 

I also had the brief pleasure of working with my brother Jonathan (when I left Maxima fulltime as a developer, Jonathan had just joined) while I wished we had more time to work together, I'm excited that Jonathan is going to carry on with Maxima when I am gone and has also taken up involvement in the DeveloperUG as one of the curent organizers.
