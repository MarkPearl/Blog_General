For those who haven't heard yet, this year my family and I will be going through some big changes. This week I received confirmation from New Zealand immigration services that my work visa has been approved. Early next month I will be joining MYOB in their Auckland offices to work with fellow South African Martin Cronje in creating some great software. Moving to the other side of the world with a young family is no small decision - it's been emotionally a roller coaster ride - the hardest part the realization that we will be leaving family and friends behind - however there is also the excitement of going to a new place and starting a new chapter in our lives.
