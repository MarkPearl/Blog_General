#### We're moving ####

For those who haven't heard yet, this year my family and I will be going through some big changes. This week I received confirmation from New Zealand immigration services that my work visa has been approved. Early next month I will be joining MYOB in their Auckland offices to work with fellow South African Martin Cronje.

Moving to the other side of the world with a young family is no small decision, it's been an emotional roller coaster ride. The hardest part of the move is the realization that we will be leaving family and friends we love behind - some of whom we may not see for a long time.  

While we are sad to go, we are also excited. Having spent a brief time visiting New Zealand, we are looking forward to raising a family there. We are under no illusions that New Zealand will have it's own set of challenges and opportunities - but this post is not going to be about that. Today I would like write about some of the things I start that I will soon be saying goodbye to. 

#### Maxima Software ####

In 2001 I started a small software company creating manufacturing software for the kitchen industry - we called the company [Maxima Software](http://www.maximasoftware.co.za/). At the time I was young and naive with aspirations of making my millions. This month I resigned as managing director of Maxima and sold my remaining shares in the company - bringing to an end a 15 year involvement. 

Did Maxima achieve what I wanted it to achieve? Well, I never made my millions from it if that's what you are wondering - I did however learn a bunch of things. Without Maxima I wouldn't have had the opportunity to take a 2 year sabatical to serve as a fulltime missionry for the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints](https://www.lds.org) - an experience that had a major impact on my life, who I married, my children and what I value.
