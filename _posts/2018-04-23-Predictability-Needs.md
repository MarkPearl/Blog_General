Saw this on twitter on predictability, thought it was worth considering...

So you want predictability...

* Let us focus 100% on the effort  
* Colocate everyone (the capital "T" Team). Remove all dependencies  
* Give us the tools we need, and provision consistent environments  
* Establish a psychologically safe environment for the team  
* Provide instant and direct access to customers for research/validation  
* Provide access to meaningful data and insights  
* Let us work down on relevant technical debt (that will impact predictability)  
* Let us hire people who have solved this exact problem in a perfectly similar context  
* Let us use the software development methodology that suits us  
* Make meeting rooms and soudproof rooms available at all times  
* Make anyone who is supposed to review/sign-off instantly available to team  
* Give the team time to get to know each other, and establish trust  
* Remove all extraneous non-value-add processes  
* Eliminate any managerial sub-optimization, politics, and buereaucracy  
* In lieu of all this, we'll do what we can on our end. We'll do our best
