Well… this is going to be another really short blog posting. I have been meaning to read more about IOC containers and came across [this blog post](http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/designpatterns/InversionOfControlAndDependencyInjectionWithCastleWindsorContainerPart1.aspx) which seemed to really explain the concept well – based on Castle Windsor.

I also  enjoyed reading the replies about [IOC](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3058/what-is-inversion-of-control) on stack overflow and what it meant.

If anyone knows of other good articles that explain the basics really well – wont you comment them to me.
