turnkey system – a complete system solution, including software and hardware, that can be turned over to the purchasing organization
request for proposal (RFP) – a formal document, containing details on the system requirements, sent to vendors to request that they bid on supplying hardware, software, and/or support services
benchmark – an evaluation of a system against some standard
Example Questions for the Chapter
What is meant by application deployment environment? Why is it important in the consideration of a developmental approach?
Explain the fundamentals of facilities management
What is meant by ERP? How does an ERP approach affect acquiring a new solution?
Deciding on Scope & Level of Automation
Prioritizing requirements includes tasks to define both the scope and the level of automation for the system.

Controlling a Projects Scope

A common problem with development projects is scope creep. One way to reduce scope creep is to formalize the process to identify, categorize, and prioritize the functions that will be included within the system. The team needs to decide which functions are critical and need to be included and which can be deferred until later.

Predictive projects are less prone to scope creep while due to the nature of adaptive projects scope creep is easier to occur.

Determining the Level of Automation

Usually the level of automation can be defined in three categories…

low – system only provides simple record keeping
medium –combination from the high level & low level
high – system takes over as much as possible
Selecting Alternatives

After identified functions have been prioritized and the levels of automation have been analyzed, the project team reviews all the alternatives. The following list helps identify some of the key criteria used in the evaluation…

Strategic Plan – does the feature fall in line with the overall strategic plan
Economic Feasibility – Higher levels of automation cost more
Schedule & Resource Feasibility – Higher levels of automation take longer to implement and require more resources
Technological Feasibility – Higher levels of automation make bigger demands on technology
Operational, Organizational, and Cultural Feasibility – Changes in business process involve risk – higher automation leads to more risk
Feasibility Factors – economic, schedule, resource, technological, organizational feasibility and risk are used to evaluate the initial feasibility of a project and the feasibility of each alternative.

Defining the Application Deployment Environment
Application deployment environment is the configuration of computer equipment, system software, and networks for the new system. One of the primary considerations in developing a new information system is the application deployment environment.

Hardware, System Software, And Networks

When choosing or defining the deployment environment, analysts are concerned with several important characteristics including the following…

Compatibility with System Requirements
Compatibility among Hardware and System Software
Required Interfaces to External Systems
Conformity with the IT Strategic Plan & Architecture Plan
Cost & Schedule
Development Tools

The development environment are the programming languages, CASE tools, and other software used to develop application software.

The deployment environment usually restricts choosing the development environment – i.e. if the client machines are Linux based you will probably not develop in .Net.

Application deployment environment choices, particularly the operating system, DBMS, and distributed software standard tend to limit the development environment tools.

Choosing Implementation Alternatives
Once the requirements are defined & decisions are made on the level of automation necessary, implementation of the system needs to be determined. There are several alternatives…

Facilities management or Service provider Solutions
Turnkey or Packaged Solutions
Enterprise Resource Planning Solutions
Custom-built solutions
Facilities Management or Service Provider Solution

Facilities management is the outsourcing of all data processing and information technology to outside vendor. It is not an actual development technique or implementation alternative but more a strategic decision. Usually this decision is made by top level management.

Service Provider Solutions is when a company only buys the required services. No in-house computing capability is required. i.e. hosting a website.

With both facilities management and service provider solutions, the company depends entirely on outside providers.

Packaged, Turnkey Software & ERP Systems

A packaged software is software that is already built and can be purchased as a package. The definition implies that the software is used as is, with no modifications.

A turnkey system is a complete system solution, including software and hardware, that can be turned over to the purchasing organization. Basically the company gets the hardware and the software all set up and all they need to do is “turn it on”. One problem with turnkey solutions is that they often do not exactly meet the needs of an organization, and the business usually needs to modify they way it works to suit the software.

Custom-Built Software Systems

Custom built software are those that are developed partly or completely by an outside organization and tailored to the exact needs of the business. The new system is developed from scratch. The advantage is the software once implemented should meet the exact needs of the organization. The disadvantage is the time and cost to implement custom built software systems.

Selecting an Implementation Alternative

Selecting a new system is not just a matter of “make" or buy” or “outsourcing”. There are many combinations of implementations and support approaches to consider.

It is important that the criteria are well established for evaluating the best approach.

There are 3 major areas to consider in selecting an implementation alternative:

General requirements
Technical requirements
Functional requirements
The following list identifies several criteria that can be included under general requirements…

Performance record of the provider
Level of technical support from the provider
Availability of experienced staff
Development cost
Expected value of benefits
Length of time until deployment
Impact on internal resources
Requirements for internal expertise
Organizational impacts
Expected cost of data conversion
Warranties and support services from outside vendor
The following list identifies several criteria that can be included under technical requirements…

Robustness
Programming errors
Quality of code
Documentation
Ease of installation
Flexibility
Structure
User-friendliness
Performance
Scalability
Compatibility with operating environment
Functional requirements would be identified based on the business needs.

Contracting with Vendors
A Request for proposal (RFP) is a formal document, containing details on the system requirements, sent to vendors to request that they bid on supplying hardware, software, and/or support services. Often this is the best way to get a selection of alternatives to choose from.

Generating a RFP

Use of RFP’s is almost universal in government contracts. The project manager has primary responsibility for developing the RFP and evaluating submitted proposals. A RFP is often considered to be a contractual offer, and a vendor’s response represents an acceptance of that offer.

The RFP should clearly state the procedural requirements for submitting a valid proposal. For more detail on RFP’s see pages 305 & 306 of the book.

Benchmarking and choosing a vendor

Some applications are possible to benchmark. To benchmark a system is to evaluate the system against some standard.

If benchmarking is not possible, it is also possible to evaluate the system in other ways including seeing other implementations of the systems onsite, interviewing existing businesses that use the system etc.

Developing a contract

After a final decision is made, a contract is written.

Contracts can be divided into several types which sift the risk either to the purchaser or the vendor. Fixed value contracts put the most risk on the vendor. To compensate for this risk, the vendor usually hikes the price.
