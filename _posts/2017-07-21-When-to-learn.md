If you wait to learn when the mood hits and all the “real work” is done for the day, you will never get any learning done. Instead of trying to fit learning in the cracks, you need to plan out the specific time and place where you’ll be doing this work.

I learn first thing in the morning, before the craziness starts. For me this works because by the end of the day I'm exhausted. At MYOB we encourage active learners, one of the traits that I've found determines if someone is/becomes an active learner is if they have a routine that supports learning. 

Adhoc learning produces adhoc results!
