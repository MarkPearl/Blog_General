#### General ####

User Stories are meant for a conversation or are a pointer to a conversation.
Cards are intentionally small.

Short simple statements told from the perspective of the user.
The story text we write on cards is less important than the conversations they trigger  

#### Three C's of User Stories ####

- Card (Stories are traditionally written on cards, Cards may be annotated with estimates / notes)
- Conversation (Details behind the story come out during conversations with product owner)
- Confirmation (Acceptance tests confirm the story was coded correctly)

#### Recommended Format ####

As ...  
So that ... (Optional)  
I want ...  

#### Conditions of Satisfaction ####

- Written on the back of the card. If these things are done, the story is complete.  
- Can be considered as acceptance criteria.
- Mike Cohn prefers to call these conditions of satisfaction because it avoids the word "tests" instead of acceptance tests.  

#### Details added in smaller sub stories ####

Big stories break down into smaller stories.  
Small stories break down into conditions of satisfaction or acceptance criteria.  

#### Useful Terms ####

Epic - a big user story  
Theme - a group of related user stories  

#### Story Writing Workshops ####

- Story writing workshops should happen every few sprints  
- Whole team present  
- Brainstorm to generate stories  
- Have a boundary set on what will be discussed  
- Start with epics and iterate  
- Have a graphical arrangement or order to display them  

#### Why are user stories a good thing ####

- User stories help us shift from doucments to discussion  
- Myth that if requirements are written down, the user will get what they want  
- Documents encourage you to build what they ask for, but not what they need - user stories encourage the opposite  
- Words are imprecise (Entree comes with sour or salad and bread)  
- User Stories are understandable (most people understand them, low training level)
- Support and encourage iterative development (start with epics and disaggregate close to development time)
- User Stories are the right size for planning  
- User Stories support opportunistic design (Mix of top down and bottom up design)  
- User Stories support participatory design  
- By focusing on the system goals instead of the system attributes we are more like to build what we need
