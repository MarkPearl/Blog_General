Here are some notes I got from a talk by Martin Fowler at Agile Africa 13.

Agile Essence & Fluency  
- what does Alistair Cokburn do?
Predictive Planning?  
Requirement Stability  
Reserach Frederick Windslow Taylor 1856 - 1915  
Good People who worked well with together  
You can't impose process on people

Agile Fluency Model - Dianna Larsend and James Shore  
Evolutionary Design, TDD, Refactoring  
Economics tends to win over morality  

Pleasant User Interface - External Quality  
Few Defect  
Good Modular Design (Internal Quality)  

[Design Stamina Hypothesis](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DesignStaminaHypothesis.html)

Saving in the short term  
Stealing in the long term
