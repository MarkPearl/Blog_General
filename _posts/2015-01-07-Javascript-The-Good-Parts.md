I was initially surprised about how thin this book is, but then again, it is the good parts of JavaScript ;-)

I come from a traditional Object Oriented (OO) world. I made the mistake of thinking that because JavaScript looks like Java or C# that it acts like these languages. I was wrong.

If you are a developer from a traditional OO background you need to read this book. It will fundamentally change the way you look at JavaScript. You will suddenly realize how different JavaScript is from traditional OO languages and why you have been feeling so much pain.

I'm going to be reading this book several times. You need to do the same.
