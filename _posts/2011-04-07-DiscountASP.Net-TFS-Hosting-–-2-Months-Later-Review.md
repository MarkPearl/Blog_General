title: DiscountASP.Net TFS Hosting – 2 Months Later Review
tags: 
category: General

In February I did a post about moving to DiscountASP.Net TFS Hosting from SVN. I promised to give some feedback a few months later to say how we were finding it.

Well, it has been 2 months and no headaches yet. So far we have been running 5 projects on TFS on DiscountASP.Net service with work items / bug items and web access and the service has been 100% stable. So good job DiscountASP.Net

If anyone is interested in finding out more about their hosting solutions I am quite happy to give them a plug – they can click here to find out more info.
