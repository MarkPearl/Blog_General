title: C# Concisely by Judith Bishop and Nigel Horspool
tags: 
category: Book

In my quest to read all the books I have lying on my bookshelf I have finally got round to finishing C# Concisely (ISBN 0-321-15418-5). While this book was fairly old, I found it to be quite useful for a student wanting to learn C# for the first time, and a nice way to review and make I hadn’t missed something when I was learning the language.

The book is simple and explains the basic concepts in a clean manner, but is really intended for the beginner programmer – it also had a few chapters dedicated to winforms, which was an indication of its age. None the less, I will keep it on the bookshelf so when I come across someone who is wanting to learn the language I can give them it as a gift.
