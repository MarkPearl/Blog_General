####  Notes ####

The word *Cynefin*, pronounced ki-neh-vin is commonly translated as "habitat" or "place".

Cynefin is a *decision framework*. It recognises the causal differences that exist between different types of systems, proposing new approaches to decision making in complex social environments. Cynefin is also a sense-making model, not a categorisation model.  

In a categorisation model, the framework precedes the data. This is good for exploitation but not exploration. 
In a sense-making model the data precedes the framework, making it good for exploration.
