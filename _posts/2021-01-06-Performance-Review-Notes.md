Make sure review is accurate and helpful  
  
Accurate  
- Needs to understand the care for which you observe them  
- The more accurate they feel the review, the more they value the process  
  
Helpful  
- Is it useful for the person to understand this, will it make a difference  
- Suggest strategies, people they want to connect with and training that may be beneficial  
- Think about patterns or trends  
  
To form the review first review the data  
- your notes  
- attendance records  
- work samples  
- employee's self review  
- 360' feedback  
- Third-party feedback  
- Achievement, times they have been recognised  
  
  
Self review  
- make sure it's completed on time  
- consistency between narrative and self-ratings  
- gaps between how they rated themselves and their own work  
  
  
Writing the review  
- start with writing the narrative, what's the overall impression of the employee  
- only once you have written the narrative then put ratings  
  
## Language review  
- remove any emotional words  
- remove extreme words or phrases (horrible, brilliant)  
- frame things as opportunities (your client is very angry with you vs. you have an opportunity to improve your client relationship)
