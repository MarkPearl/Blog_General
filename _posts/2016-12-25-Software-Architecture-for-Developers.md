title: Software Architecture for Developers Volume 1 by Simon Brown

In this book Simon Brown goes through the mindset of software architecture. I found the book to have pragmatic agile view of software architecture. Simon's main argument is that software architecture is still important and that teams that do too much or too little software architecture put themselves in a dangerous position. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to get a better understanding of modern software architecture role.

- coherent piece of software that satisfies the original drivers.
