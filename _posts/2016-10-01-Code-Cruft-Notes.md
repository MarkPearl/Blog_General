### What is code cruft?

<img class="img-responsive" alt="Cruft Definition" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/Technical-Debt-Cruft-Definition.png">

Code cruft is redundant, old, or improperly written code!

### Where does it come from?

> Bad code often feels faster in the same way hurrying feels faster  		

### Don't confuse cruft with technical debt

Code cruft is not technical debt. Dirty code was never intended to be included in the technical debt metaphor. It makes writing dirty code seem to be a strategic decision, when it isn't.

### How to avoid cruft

Label it, creating a rating system and building code in a modular way		

Encode your standards into a linter or other static analyzer. Start with an almost empty set of rules, and then slowly add as you agree upon standards for your code.
