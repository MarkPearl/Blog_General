Today I finally succumbed to temptation and ordered my Trossen Robotics RFID reader starter kit. I am looking forward to playing around with the device, a few ideas already came to mind, but we shall see just how easy it is to use.

Hopefully I can not get to distracted by it and study properly for my up coming exams, but it is also fun to spoil oneself once in a while and have a bit of fun!
