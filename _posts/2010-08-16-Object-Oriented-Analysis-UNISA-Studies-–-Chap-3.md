Example Questions for the Chapter
List the seven reasons why projects fail
What are three reasons why projects are initiated
Explain how information system project management is similar to project management in general
Project Management
Project management is the organizing and directing other people to achieve a planned result within a predetermined schedule and budget.

There are many reasons why projects do not fulfil the desired objectives or are only partially successful. They include the following…

Incomplete or changing system requirements
Limited user involvement
Lack of executive support
lack of technical support
Poor project planning (including inadequate risk assessment)
Unclear objectives (including unreasonable expectations)
Lack of required resources
Additional studies of successful projects help to highlight some reasons why projects succeed. They include…

Clear system requirements
Substantial user involvement
Support from upper management
Thorough and detailed project plans
Realistic work schedules and milestones
The questions is then asked, how can we improve the project success rate? Companies that have achieved this have attacked the problem from three different angles…

Identify best practices in project management & train project their project leaders on these practices
They adopt a system development methodology
They pay particular attention to factors that influence project success and focus on instituting characteristics of successful projects
The Role of a Project Manager

The project manager defines and executes project management tasks
The project manager serves as the director or locus of control for the project team and all their activities
The following identifies a few of the internal responsibilities…

Identify project tasks and build a work breakdown structure
Develop the project schedule
Recruit and train team members
Assign team members to tasks
Coordinate activities of team members and sub teams
Asses project risks
Monitor and control project deliverables and milestones
Verify the quality of project deliverables
Some of the major external responsibilities include the following…

Report the project’s status and progress
Establish good working relationships with those who identify the needed system requirements
Work directly with the client and other stakeholders
Identify resource needs and obtain resources
Project Management through the SDLC

Three major project management processes overlap the SDLC processes…

Executing
Controlling
Closing
There are two types of life cycles in the SDLC,

Predictive
Adaptive
With either approach the role of the project manager is slightly different, because these approaches are different, however with either approach the project manager will be involved in all three SLDC processes.

Project Management and the Level of Formality

Depending on the scope of the project, the level of formality in the project planning may vary
Smaller projects may be less formal, while larger projects may be more formal
Also, whether the project is predictive or adaptive also effects the level of formality
In some of the newer agile approaches the level of formality is a lot lower with the emphasis being on things being useful rather than conforming to procedure.

Project Management Knowledge Areas

There are many professional organizations that focus on project management. One of the these organizations, the PMI, has established a body of knowledge called the PMBOK which has 9 different knowledge areas…

Project Scope Management
Project Time Management
Project Cost Management
Project Quality Management
Project Human Resource Management
Project Communication Management
Project Risk Management
Project Procurement Management
Project Integration Management
Project Initiation and Project Planning
Information system development projects are initiated for various reasons, three general driving forces are as follows…

To respond to an opportunity
To resolve a problem
To conform to a directive
Some project are initiated to respond to an opportunity. These projects are usually initiated through strategic planning and are called top-down projects. To prioritize these projects, companies use a technique called a weighted score.

A weighted score is a method to prioritize projects based on criteria with unequal weights.

Projects are also initiated to solve an immediate business problem. These projects attempt to close the gap between what is required to run the business correctly and what is currently in operation.

Projects are also initiated to conform to a directive. For example, legislature by government.

Whatever the source of the new project, be sure to carefully evaluate its feasibility before proceeding.

Project Planning Activities

Both predictive and adaptive projects begin with overall project planning. The major difference between the two types of projects is the level of detail provided.

Predictive projects tend to attempt to plan the entire project upfront while adaptive projects leave much of the detail to be developed during the iteration.

The project planning activities of the SDLC consist of the activities required to get the project organized and started. They include the following…

Define the problem
Produce the project schedule
Confirm project feasibility
Staff the project
Launch the project
Defining the Problem
Carefully defining the problem is one of the most important activities of the project. The objective is to define precisely the business problem to be solved and thereby determine the scope of the new system.

Defining the problem can be divided up into individual tasks, for example the following tasks would be valid…

Review the business needs that originally initiated the project
Identify at a high level the expected capabilities of the new system
Possibly build preliminary prototypes
Develop diagrams mapping the flow of data in and out of the system
The key question to be answered when completing the problem definition activity is: Do we understand what we are supposed to be working on?

Producing the Project Schedule
When producing a project schedule it is important to understand the definitions of two keywords…

Task –is the smallest piece of work that is identified and scheduled
Activity – an activity is made up of a group of related tasks or other smaller activities
During project planning it may not be possible  to schedule every task in the entire project because it is to early to know all of the tasks that will be necessary, however one of the requirements of project planning is to provide estimates of the time to complete the project and the total cost of salaries.

The development of a project schedule is divided into three main steps…

Develop a work breakdown structure
Build a schedule using a Gantt chart
Develop a resource requirements and the staffing plan
A work breakdown structure (WBS) is the hierarchy of phases, activities, and tasks of a project; one method to estimate and schedule the tasks of a project.

The for most effective techniques for identifying the tasks of the WBS are…

Top-down – identify major activities first and then listing internal tasks
Bottom-up – listing all the tasks you can think of and then organizing them later
Template – Using a standard template of tasks for projects that are fairly standard
Analogy – Finding a similar, or analogous, project that is finished and copying its tasks
Usually teams try to use the analogy or template approach first.

When developing a WBS, to help determine if you have the right level of detail you can apply the following guidelines…

There should be a way to recognize when the task is complete
The definition of the task should be clear enough so that someone can estimate the amount of effort required to complete it
As a general rule for software, the effort should take 2 to 10 working days
To know more about a Gannt chart see the wiki.

Identifying Project Risks and Confirming Project Feasibility
Project feasibility analysis is an activity that verifies whether a project can be started and successfully completed. Generally the following activities are perfomed when confirming project feasibility…

Assess the risk to the project
Determine the organizational and cultural feasibility
Evaluate the technological feasibility
Determine the schedule feasibility
Assess the resource feasibility
Determine the economic feasibility
Assess the risk to the project

During the project initiation the primary objective of risk management is to identify potential risks and assess their negative impact. One of the best ways to do this is to have a brainstorming session which includes key project members.

Determine the organizational and cultural feasibility

Evaluate & identify organizational & cultural issues  that pose potential risks for the new system. These could include…

current low level of computer competency
substantial computer phobia
perceived loss of control by staff or management
potential shifting of political and organizational power due to the new system
fear of change of job responsibilities
fear of loss of employment due to increased automation
reversal of long standing work procedures
Evaluate the technological feasibility

assess carefully the proposed technological requirements & available expertise
Determine the schedule feasibility

the project team should build the schedule without any preconceived notion of required completion dates.
compare the schedule to key times – i.e. for a university admissions system, identify when admissions start so that one knows when the system must be implemented by.
Assess the resource feasibility

Be aware of the resource feasibility of the project. This includes Economic Feasibility.

Economic feasibility consists of two tests…

Is the anticipated value of the benefits greater than projected costs of development?
Does the organization have adequate cash flow to fund the project during the development period?
For a full description on feasibility refer to the chapter in the book.

Completing the Feasibility Analysis

For a project to be viable it should pass  all of the feasibility tests. If it is not feasible in one area, either adjustments need to be made or the project cancelled.

Staffing & Launching the Project
The staffing activity consists of 5 tasks…

Develop a resource plan for the project
Identify and request specific technical staff
Identify and request specific user staff
Organize the project team into workgroups
Conduct preliminary training and team-building exercises
