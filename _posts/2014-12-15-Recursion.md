#### Avoiding Pitfalls ####

Here are a few suggestions for avoiding common pitfalls when working with recursion.  

- Manipulating large values or complex objects will likely require explicit type, and boundary, checks such as those found within an iterative implementations.  
- Applying simplistic recursive thinking without care  may lead to incorrect results and performance issues.  
- Maintaining state within a deep recursive call chain may demand refactoring or workarounds, such as, tail calls.  
- Debugging difficulties that are encountered when using  non-trivial recursive methods may dictate logging and perseverance.
