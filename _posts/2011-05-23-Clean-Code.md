If Code Complete is the textbook of software construction, then Clean Code is the poetry of it. This book had a number of concepts that struck true to me - self documenting code, structure, design - it is all there in Clean Code.

I did not go through all the code samples, although I intend on reading this book again and again as I suspect there is a ton there I did not pick up the first time round.
