I recently co-facilitated a community Code Retreat with a friend of mine. For those not familiar with what a Code Retreat is you can learn more about them on the [Global Day of Code Retreat site](https://www.coderetreat.org/).

This Code Retreat was slightly different in that we used two different katas (gasp), we started with the classic Conways Game of Life kata which we did for 4 sesions followed by a PacMan kata for another 4 sessions.

* Normal get to know Conways GoL (with a constraint added in the last 15 minutes)
* Ping Pong TDD
* Evil coder
* Everything immutable

* Normal get to know PacMan
* No loops / no conditionals (no LINQ)
* ?

Having two problems in a Code Retreat seemed to work well. There was increased energy from the group when we changed the problem and I feel this helped keep people engaged. For those interested in using the PacMan kata you can find information about it on the [Coding Dojo site](http://codingdojo.org/kata/PacMan/).
