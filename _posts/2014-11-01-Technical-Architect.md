#### What's the difference between Architect & a normal Developer?

> Software architecture is about the significant design decisions, where significance is measured by cost of change”

I see the difference between a normal developer and a software architect being that a normal developer primarily has a high involvment in maintenance and development of the system at hand. The architect still has a level of involvement in maintenance and development at hand, but also is a key player in providing guidance to a team when they are looking at significant design decisions. 

I also see part of the role of the architect to get involved in 

* Championing cross cutting concerns between systems
* Challenges the development team to help them implement a better design.
* Championing and identifying and balancing functional requirements a system (scalability, compatability, performance, etc).  
* Championing and identifying suitable technology stacks and frameworks for a system

#### Mentoriship & Knowledge Share

* Architect should be providing technical leadership in teams, they should be helping teams identify technical areas of improvment at a regular cadence
* Provide regular (weekly) 1-on-1 mentorship for one or two experienced developers 
* Reguarly pair/mob with teams to provide hands on mentorship in crafting code, TDD, design, etc

#### How much architecture should you have? 

> Just enough architecture
