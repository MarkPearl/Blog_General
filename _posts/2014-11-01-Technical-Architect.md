#### Summary ####

Difference between normal developer and technical architect is that a developer is only given responsibility at a component level of the system (i.e. dev makes sure the at a component level the system stays open for changes). Technical architect is responsible for technical direction of the system and making sure it stays open for changes.

Has accountability for identifying and balancing the functional requirements of the system (scalability, compatability, performance, etc).  

Technical architect identifies the most suitable technology stack and frameworks for the system.  

Challenges the development team to help them implement a better design.
