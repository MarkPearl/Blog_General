#### What's the difference between Architect & Developer?

Difference between normal developer and software architect is that a developer is only given responsibility at a component level of the system (i.e. dev makes sure the at a component level the system stays open for changes). Software architect is responsible for technical direction of the system and making sure it stays open for changes.

* Has accountability for identifying and balancing the functional requirements of the system (scalability, compatability, performance, etc).  
* Software architect identifies the most suitable technology stack and frameworks for the system.  
* Challenges the development team to help them implement a better design.
