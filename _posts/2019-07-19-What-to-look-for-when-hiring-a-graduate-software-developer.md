Today I want to spend some time thinking through what to look for when hiring a graduate software developer. Prior to being involved in our graduate programme I would never have thought this was an interesting question. As I dig more into it I'm realizing what an interesting question it is.

## Before interviewing graduate software developers...

Before I go into the evolution of interviewing graduate software developers let me quickly go through what I used to look for when interviewing software developers in general. Let me share a snapshot of my normal interview process at around 2016.

The goal was to identify a candidate that would be contributing as soon as possible to the team that was also a good fit for the team. This process was used for experienced software engineers (people that had a couple of years under their belt) and was a 4 step process. We would look at:

1) Cultural fit and software process mindset  
2) Technology competency  
3) Coding skills assessment  
4) Team fit  

Let me dig into what we covered at each step.

### Cultural fit and software process mindset

Generally this would be an unscripted conversation. We would talk about what got them into software. What they look for in a team. Why they are leaving their current team / position. How they handle conflict. You get the idea. We would also have a chat about team software processes. What does agile mean to them, when would you adopt a particular team process to making software (Scrum, Kanban, etc.) At the very end I would answer any questions around our company values and how we see the world or anything else they want to know about.

### Technology competency

The next step was a technology competency assessment. Do they know the tech we use, how much of this tech did they really understand and at what level of understanding. Again this would be conversation style with potential whiteboarding. We would talk about the tech stack, there would be some general questions around technology they have used. Things they would do or avoid. Often we would map out a build pipeline or something along those lines.

### Coding skills assessment

Next up was the coding skills assessment. This was usually done using pair programming. We would pick a code kata and see if they could solve it. We would use a form called strong pairing where the candidate would be the navigator and the interviewer the driver. This would give me a good idea on whether they write clean code. Do they use a TDD approach. What they would be like to pair with and so on.

### Team fit

The final step would be a team fit session. The candidate would get to meet the team. We would usually do a "agile game", something where we needed to build something together as a group and collaborate together followed by general Q&A from the team. Post the session the team would get together to share their thoughts. If the team was in favor of proceeding they would get an offer.

### My thoughts around this process 

The challenge with this approach was it was lengthy, generally someone is looking for work as soon as possible and with the multiple stages it took time. Good experienced software developers are in high demand so there was always pressure from our internal recruiters to speed up the process so we didn't loose this person to the competition. 

I'm also not sure how effective some of the steps were. To be honest, retrospectively I don't think I got much out of the culture fit conversations or even the technology conversations. It was also hit and miss with the team fit session, sometimes it went great and sometimes not so great. If team members were poor at asking questions they got canned responses - I've never found anyone in an interview to tell you they don't like collaborating with others or giving good feedback.

I would rate the over all process as a 5 out of 10. Not terrible, but not great.

## Now you have to interview graduate software developers

When I moved into the graduate space I suddenly had a problem. Most of my traditional measures were no longer useful. Coding skills were not applicable, most graduates have what I call an academic style to coding (lots of comments, mangled messes and badly structured). Discussions around code construction and design are beyond the scope of their current abilities. Technology competency is irrelevant. You realize that you will be teaching most if not all the technology to the graduate once they join. 

- Do they have good software engineering practices (clean code, understand modern processes, pairing, refactoring, design)
- This is their career, they've proven that they are going to operate in this space effectively


Why this falls apart for very new software developers
- - You realize you will be teaching them the tech / how to code professionally
- They have no references from people they have worked for in the past (no dev experience)
- They have a very thin tech stack knowledge, generally they know names of a few frameworks, often they don't match up with what you are looking for
- You don't know if they will actually enjoy being a software developer... code endurance

How does this change our approach to interviewing?
- You can still focus on culture, do they add to our culture
- Have they demonstrated some sort of endurance to coding (university coding course, internship, hobby programming)
- Are they a strong critical thinker
- How much time will we invest in them before we can get value... what are the foundational principles we are looking for? If someone hasn't demonstrated that they are a great software developer... what attributes would give us an indication that they will be one eventually?

First attempt we came up with
- Have they demonstrated an tendency to code
- Are they a collaborator, can they work with others[
- Do they like the industry we operate in (have they shown an interest in Accounting, what problem we solve, the company)
- Can they think of a problem end to end and then go deep and into the nitty gritty's
- Are they passionate about software

Second attempt 
- Are they show an apptitude to be able to learn new concepts quickly

Third attempt
- Have they demonstrated an tendency to code
- Do they ask questions or make assumptions
- Are they good at problem solving, given a lot of unknowns can they navigate their way through to a solution
- Domain Modelling. Are they able to conceptualize a domain and handle how behaviour and data
- Knowledge Representation. Can they represent knowledge effectively so it is easy to consume
- Efficiency in problem solving - How easily can they solve a problem
- Abstraction / modularity - Can they think at different levels, are they able to think abstractly about a problem and then give concrete examples of abstract concepts
- Novelty / creativity - Can they look at a problem in different angles
- Categorization - Can they categorize things, group them
- Communication skills with experts in other domaions - Can they communicate with other effectively, verbal, written, etc.
- Adoption of good practices in software engineering - Do they have great software engineering practices
