When you are in the mob...

There needs to be balance between holding your ground and compromising.
Be assertive without being aggressive. 
Choose your conversations wisely; save them for things that really matter.  
Practice active listening by acknowledging, restating, and summarizing ideas when appropriate.   
Be empathetic towards others in the mob.  

Someone who *always* gives in to others suggestions is doing a great disservice to the mob.  
Someone who *never* gives others ideas a fair chance is also doing a great disservice to the mob.  
Mob's that insist on debating every single issue are impeding progress.
