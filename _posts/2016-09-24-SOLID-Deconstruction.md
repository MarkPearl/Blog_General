These notes are based on [Kevlin Henney](https://twitter.com/KevlinHenney) talk on "[SOLID Deconstruction](https://vimeo.com/157708450)" done at NDC London 2016.

#### General

SOLID Princples are not quite right...
- Two ideas rolled into one  
- One is subordinate to the other  
- One is not even a practice at all  

#### Are these principles?

Dictionary defitions of principle
- A fundamental truth   
- Foundation for a system of belief 
- Morally correct behavior or attitude 
- General scientific theorem or law  

A more suitable word is **pattern** - a pattern is a context specific piece of advice.

Advice is contextually good, but change the context and the advice could be bad.

Dictionary defition of pattern  
- A regular form or sequence discernable in the way in which something happens or is done  
- An example for others to follow  

> It turns out words matter, in software we use a bunch of words but we are fairly rubbish in using them.

#### Single Responsibility  

Robert C Martin described this concept being based on the principle of cohesion, as described by Tom Demarco in his book **Structured Analysis and System Specification**.
