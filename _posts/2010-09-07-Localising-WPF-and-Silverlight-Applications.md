A while back I looked into localising a WPF application. Because I prefer the MVVM application I wanted something that I could apply to the UI layer specifically in XAML.

At the time I found a post on Codeplex that allowed me to achieve this, but when we moved from VS2008 to VS2010 it broke the whole system.

I am glad to see that an update to this tool is now available here

<Update>

After speaking to my friend Brendon he pointed me to another post about the same topicâ€¦

Ironically, I never even realized that most of the functionality I was looking for from the external tool was baked into VS.
