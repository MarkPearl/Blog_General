Lave and Wenger (1991) studied various types of apprenticeships. They stress the following:

* importance of an apprentice to participate actively  
* to have legitimate work to do  
* to work on the periphery, steadily moving toward some higher rank  
* the novices work is initially simple and non critical  
* later work is more ciritical  
* critical that apprentice works within a "line of sight" of the expert  
* the beginner explicityly acquires skills from hearing and/or seeing th expert  

Alistair Cockburn created the "Expert-in-Earshot" management pattern, the experts are put in the same workspace as nocies so that the novices can learn by watching and listening while the expert does his/her work
