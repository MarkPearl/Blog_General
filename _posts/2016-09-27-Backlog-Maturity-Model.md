As things near their due date you would expect them to move into adaptive or conversationl. Stuff in Chaos or Emergent are typically further off.

### Explantion of area

#### Chaotic

- High uncertainty of requirements, low team understanding. 
- Possibly epics only, some features perhaps.  
- High degree of change is prevalent. 

#### Emergent 

- High BA understanding and some team involvement.  
- Requirements are still emerging and uncertain.  
- Features are mostly known and prioritised, high level sizing is done. 
- A rough guideline to the approach to be taken for MMP/MVP and a proposed Road Map 

#### Adaptive

- Team has a good understanding of business value, requirements and have the ability to decompose features into stories.   
- Most stories are present and are sized. 
- There may be some uncertainty in some stories and those questions are answered adequately.  
- Story grooming is regular, dependencies are known.  

#### Conversational 

- High team understanding and high certainty of requirements and acceptance criteria.  
- Stories are discussed conversationally, story grooming is on ad hoc basis, backlog is “self-healing”.   
- Definition of DONE is in align with PO expectations.
