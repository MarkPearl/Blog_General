Aims of this chapter
Discuss how to plan and run a successful data gathering program
Enable you to plan and run an interview
Enable you to design a simple questionnaire
Enable you to plan and execute an observation
Summary
Four Key Issues
Setting Goals – outline what the objective of the exercise is
The relationship with participants – get participants to give permission to have their data used if necessary
Triangulation – Use more than one data gathering technique to tackle a goal
Pilot Studies – Run a pilot study before doing the main study to iron out bugs, do not use the same people in the pilot study in the main study as they now have an expectation
Data Recording
Various methods and tools to use to assist in recording data including…

Notes plus camera
Audio plus camera
Video
Interviews
Unstructured Interviews – Open ended conversational
Structured Interviews – Predetermined questions are asked with available answers i.e. which of the following best describes…
Semi-Structured Interviews – Combination of Unstructured and Semi-Structured
Focus Groups – Facilitator with group members
Planning and conducting an interview

Involves developing the set of questions or topics to be covered. Developing interview questions requires determining if the questions will be open or closed. The following are suggestions…

Compound sentences can be confusing, so split them into two separate questions
Interviewers may not understand jargon or complex language
Try and keep questions neutral
Running an interview

Have an introduction – interviewer introduces himself
Warm-up session – easy non-threatening questions
Main session – questions presented in logical order
Cool off period – few easy questions
Closing session – end the interview
Questionnaires
Designing questionnaires with structure include…

Think about ordering of questions. Impact can be effected by order
Consider whether you need different versions of questionnaires for different populations
Provide clear instructions on how to complete the questionnaire
Find a balance between keeping whitespace and the questionnaire compact
Question and response format…

Checkboxes and ranges
Rating scales
Administering questionnaires…

2 Important issues when administering questionnaires…

Make sure you reach a representative sample of the audience
Make sure you get a reasonable response rate
Observation
Direct observation in the field

Structuring frameworks for observation in the field

The person
The place
The thing
Degree of Participation

Depends on the type of study. You can get different types of observers including

Passive Observer – does not take part, merely observers
Participant Observer – participates and interacts with those being observed
Ethnography

Is a qualitative method aimed to learn and understand cultural phenomena which reflect the knowledge and system of meanings guiding the life of a cultural group.

Choosing and combining techniques
Direct observation in controlled environments

This usually occurs in a usability laboratory. Same basic data recording techniques are used.

The think aloud technique

In a controlled environment the interviewer can afford to be more intrusive. One way is to say what they are thinking as it is happening.

Indirect observation

Diaries
Interaction Logs
