At MYOB we've been improving our graduate programme for software developers. Today I would like to share some of the insights we've gained over the last few years around a practice I call technical mentorship.

## How do I fit in

I have a software development background with a strong value placed on XP principles. For the last few years I've been guiding our graduate software developer academy at MYOB. The academy is where we employ less experienced software practitioners and through a structured learning and mentorship programme intentionally grow their capability. I cover a bit around the evolution of the structure of the programme in a [previous post](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/Evolving-graduate-programme-for-software-developers).

## Mentorship is a key pillar 

Mentorship is a key pillar in the programme. Certainly our graduates would not learn and grow as effectively as they do if we didn't have amazing dedicated mentors.  From what I've observed so far I believe the best way to grow great software developers is through mentorship.

So why is mentorship so powerful? I believe there are a number of attributes, the three that immediately stand out to me are **context**, **timing** and **human connection**.

**Context** is essential for us to learn effectively. Understanding why we are learning what we are learning is important for us to remember it. Many other forms of learning (blogs, books, online tutorials) can tell us why in general something is important but aren't able to understand our specific context and relate it back to us. Mentors are able to understand and give context.

**Timing** is just as important as context. Our brains are wired to [forget things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve), especially if they are not relevant to what we are doing right now. Great mentors focus on things relevant to our current challenges. 

**Human connection**. We learn best through **social interactions** from people we feel connected to. Mentoring done right forms a human connection between mentor and mentee that enhances the growth experience.

### The ellusive definition on mentoring

As I discovered early on, the word mentor/mentoring is a loaded word. It means vastly different things to different people. If you read the [definition on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship) it says: *"Mentoring is a process that always involves communication and is relationship-based, but its precise definition is elusive."*. 

> Mentoring(s)... precise definition is elusive

I fully agree. The precise definition of mentoring is elusive! Turns out, going back to Wikipedia you discover numerous different strains of mentoring all with their own unique names and attributes. 

Looking at these various strains of mentoring, what we do with our graduate software developer is a form of **profession or trade mentoring**. As Wikipedia explains: _A profession or trade mentor is someone who is currently in the profession the mentee is entering. That person knows the trends, important changes and new practices that the mentee should know to stay at the top of their career and helps guide them through these things._

Unfortunately I don't like the phrases _profession mentoring_ or _trade mentoring_, so I'm going to create a subset of mentoring specific to software developers, I call it **technical mentoring** (gasp and drum roll at the same time).

### What is technical mentoring?

So what is technical mentoring? Let me propose a definition...

Technical mentoring is a process for the informal transmission of knowledge, skills, and support perceived by the recipient as relevant to their development as a software professional; it entails informal communication, usually face-to-face and during a sustained period of time, between the person who is perceived to have greater relevant knowledge, wisdom, and technical skills (the mentor) and a person who is perceived to have less (the protégé)"*.

> Technical mentoring is a process for the informal transmission of knowledge, skills, and support between the mentor and the protege relevant to their development as a software professional 

### Technical mentoring is a role, not a tool

Technical mentorship is a role, not a tool or technique. Let me explain the difference. In the English language we often use the same words to describe both roles and tools. For instance "coaching" is a role and a tool, if you are the coach of a soccer team that is your role and we could say you are coaching them; if you are coaching someone through making a difficult decision, that's a tool you are using to help achieve an outcome (them gaining insights to make a decision by you asking probing questions). Technical mentorship is a role. 

There are are various tools and techniques technical mentors use to be effective. Which tool you use when mentoring largely depends on your experience and where your mentee is at in their learning journey. 

Some of the tools/techniques I've seen include:

## How do we get better at it

Now that I have briefly outlined what technical mentoring is and some of the reasons on why it is so powerful, I want to share some things we've learned around how to be better at it. I am going to focus around things specifically for technical mentoring, I've made a [separate post](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/General-mentoring-suggestions) around general mentoring.

### Adjust your approach depending on their skill level

The first thing I've learned is you need to adjust your approach depending on your mentee's skill level. The nature of how someone is mentored changes as they grow in experience and capability.  

I find the Dreyfus model of skills acquisition a useful model to use when figuring out what adjustments you need to make. 

<img class="img-responsive" alt="Dreyfus Model" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/mentoring-software-developers-dreyfus-model.gif">


Generally, in most technical capabilities graduate software developers are at the Novice or Advanced Beginner stage of Dreyfus. That means when mentoring a grad you are going to focus on providing them detailed step by step instructions or simple projects in a safe to fail environment. We've found the use of coding katas (synthetic coding problems) and group projects useful. I go through both of these later in this post.

### Put together a roadmap

The next thing I want to share is put together a roadmap. I learned this from a colleague, [John Contad](https://medium.com/faun/teaching-devops-cheaply-effectively-fairly-221732d39e15) who is someone I consider an expert at technical mentorship.

How do you do it? One way is to ask what role your mentee is aiming for next. Once you have identified that you can work together to identify the capabilities someone applying for that role needs to have to start out. Next, you identify their current capabilities. This should give a delta. 

Looking at the delta, pick a capability that you can help your grad with. Break that capability into all the little bits of information they need to have to perform that capability. Map these pieces of information into a dependency tree. Starting at the bottom and working your way up the tree you now have a roadmap.

<img class="img-responsive" alt="Dreyfus Model" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/mentoring-software-developers-knowledge-dependency.png">

Make sure your grad understands and buys into the roadmap and understands **why** certain things are there. As humans for us to remember things we need to understand **why** else we forget it very quickly.

### Learn how to effectively teach skills

The second tip I want to share is learn how to effectively teach skills. I once heard someone trying to mentor a grad say... I can't do that, that's teaching. I'm their mentor, not their teacher! While there isn't a one to one mapping between technical mentoring and teaching, often you need to leverage teaching as a tool especially if you are mentoring someone at a novice or advanced beginner level.

Now, for many of us you have an image locked in your head of what it means to be a teacher. I went to school in the 80's and 90's and teachers in those days were people that stood at the front of the class who talked a lot and wrote things on a chalk board. That's not the type of teaching I'm referring to!

Instead, I'm referring to teaching skills. Investing a bit of time into understanding the psychology behind teaching skills goes a long way to helping you effectively mentor someone. Now, you don't have to go to university to develop your teaching skills. There are a handful of models I've found useful to guide how I teach. I'm going to share a few of them below.

#### Senninger's Learning Zone Model

Senninger's learning zone model is useful in identifying if your grad is in the sweet spot for learning. It talks about there being three zones, comfort, learning and panic.

<img class="img-responsive" alt="Senningers Learning Zone Model" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/mentoring-software-developers-senningers-learning-zone-model.png">

The ideal is to have your grad in the "learning zone", in this zone learning is at its optimal. One way to identify if they are in the learning zone is by how they are feeling. 

Feelings of boredom, being comfortable, or being unchallenged are an indication your grad is in the comfort zone. It's fine being in the comfort zone for short periods of time, but when they start feeling like this it is an indication you are not challenging them enough. 

On the opposite end of the spectrum is the panic zone. In the panic zone you have feelings of anxiety, fear, exhaustion or tenseness. Being in the fear zone is dangerous. You don't learn much. If your grad is having feelings like this it is an indication that they are being stretched too much.

Where you want to have them is in the learning zone. In the learning zone they will have feelings of excitement, exhiliration and feeling challenged. In this zone learnig is at it's optimum (as a broad generalization I think many of us want to always be in the learning zone through out our career).

When your grad is in the learning zone, what's the best way for them to learn?

#### Blooms Taxonomy of Learning Model

I found Blooms Taxonomy of Learning a useful model. Bloom is a hierarchical ordering of cognitive skills that can a help mentors teach better. It looks as follows:

<img class="img-responsive" alt="Blooms Taxonomy of Learning" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/mentoring-software-developers-blooms-taxonomy-of-learning-model.jpg">

By hierarchical I mean you need to work your way up from rememeber to create. For example, you need to be able to recall facts and basic concepts first, following that you should be able to explain ideas or concepts, following that apply them and so on until you get to create where you are at a cognitive level of being able to produce new or original work.

How does this help you mentor more effectively? First, it gives you an order of progression or plan of attack when approaching a new technical concept. 

For example, if you were helping your grad learn a new programming language, you would start with activities that help them remember. This would include things like being able to recall the syntax for declaring a method, defining a varaible, passing parameters and so on. 

Only once your grad has passed the knowledge stage for the basic syntax should you focus on understanding. Do they understand why methods are useful? Why would we need varaiables? Why would we use looping constructs? And so on.

Only once you have a solid knowledge does it make sense to move on to apply. Let's solve a simple problem using the things we have learned so far. And so on...

Thinking in terms of Bloom's different levels allows you to have a structured approach in teaching and I've found it extremely useful. For instance, it may be unproductive to ask someone to debug an issue in a system without them first having passed the "apply" stage for the technology that it's been developed in. 

### Use a form of direct instruction in to learn skills 

The last technique around teaching I want to mention is that of Direct instruction. Direct instruction is a structured sequenced approach. Teachers often use it to help someone learn a concept. Mentors can use it to help somone develop a skill. I've seen different patterns or variations on the internet but the one I find most useful in the software world looks as follows:  

<img class="img-responsive" alt="Direct Instruction" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/mentoring-software-developers-direct-instruction.png">

Let me use an example of how you would use this pattern to learning a skill like Test Driven Development.

Step 1 - **Review** - First, start by reviewing what your grad has covered so far. Taking my example of "TDD in Java" above (under roadmap). We would review all the dependent information...writing a unit test (dependency injection, understanding classes) and writing normal code (basic understanding of java).

Step 2 - **Roadmap** - Next we go to roadmap. TDD in Java is next on the roadmap.

Step 3 - **Introduce new concept** - Then, you introduce the concept. What are the benefits of TDD, why do we do it. What is the theory behind it. Red, Green, Refactory circle.

Step 4 - **Guided practice** - You then move into guided practice. You may start off using pair programming as a tool to help guided practice. I would normally start by "driving" and walking through a very simple problem. Maybe a coding kata like string calculator kata. At some point in working through the problem I would ask my grad to go behind the keyboard and "drive". We may do one kata together, or several.

Step 5 - **Independent practice** - Next, get your grad to work through a similar coding kata on their own. You may get them to redo the same problem. But without your help or work through a similar problem that is focussing on the same skill (TDD).

Step 6 - **Assess understanding** - Once they have done their independent practice, as the mentor it's now up to you to assess their understanding. I would probably take pick a new problem and pair on it with them again but this time have them at the keyboard and me largely observing. We may go to the whiteboard and have them explain the concept to me. Draw out the approach they are taking and so on. 

Step 7 - **Go back to review** - Once you are finished assessing understanding you make a call if they understand a concept properly, or if you can move on to the next step in your roadmap. For all intents and purposes you are back to review.

## Coding katas or synthetic problems

We use

### Understanding motivation leads to a better experience

* People enjoy the work more, something invigorating about adding value and building stuff others will use

Cons of real problems
* Complex, often has too many things you need to understand
* Touch area on what you are actually learning can be low

are useful but can get boring

## Looking at code is often better than talking about code

First establish where someone is. If you don't you risk either them getting no value, or being stretched too much.

* Sinner's model - comfort, learning & panic. What out of what we have are they comfortable doing? How can you validate this?
* Zone of proximal development (where are they right now, what can they do on their own)

## Before you code something, have them explain it on a whiteboard 

## Pair programming is a powerful way to transfer knowlege

* If you are going to pair, have your mentee at the keyboard

Benefits of synthetic problems
* Idea of toy problems to learn new concepts. These are useful to allow you to reduce the pieces of new information being learnt and redundant information
* Falls in line with cognitive load theory

Cons of synthetic problems
* Wax on wax off without connecting to why it is important
* See this as not adding value
* Hippocampi tells you it's not important to learn and so you forget it quickly

## Group Projects


## Resist the technology as long as possible

We introduced quorum reviews where a group of mentors go together to review a particular milestone
* Saw increase in focus of mentees to cover that material
* Higher engagement during this time
* Understanding motivation (share story about drawing pictures and demotivating)

We are currently using a mixed approach where they balance time between real world systems and synthetic problems. It has it's pro's and it's cons.


## Catch up reguarly

Agree on a metric for measuring your grads learning pace at the start of the process and commit to using it every week (e.g. if we had looked at a graph of learning zones each week we would have been able to easily see whether to push more info in or back off)

Define the structure of weekly catchups early - we didn’t have a strong structure to these and so they became a bit wishy-washy towards the end.

## There is no secret formula

Unfortunately there is no formula. Every person is different and so the approach taken needs to be customized

The power behind effective mentors is they adapt to the needs of their mentee. The more tools a mentor has, the more able they are to adapt to their mentees needs
