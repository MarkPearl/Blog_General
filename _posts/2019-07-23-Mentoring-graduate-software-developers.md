At MYOB we've been improving our graduate programme for software developers. Today I would like to share some of the insights we've gained over the last few years around a practice I call technical mentorship.

## How do I fit in

I have a software development background with a strong value placed on XP principles. For the last few years I've been guiding our graduate software developer academy at MYOB. The academy is where we employ less experienced software practitioners and through a structured learning and mentorship programme intentionally grow their capability. I cover a bit around the evolution of the structure of the programme in a [previous post](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/Evolving-graduate-programme-for-software-developers).

## Mentorship is a key pillar 

Mentorship is a key pillar in the programme. Certainly our graduates would not learn and grow as effectively as they do if we didn't have amazing dedicated mentors.  

### What does mentorship mean?

As I discovered early on, the word mentorship is a loaded word. It means vastly different things to different people. If you read the [definition on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship) it says: *"Mentoring is a process that always involves communication and is relationship-based, but its precise definition is elusive."*. 

> Mentoring(s)... precise definition is elusive

I fully agree with the precise definition of mentorship being elusive. From what I have found there are many different forms of mentorship. Having looked at the ones listed on Wikipedia, the closest form of mentoring to the type of mentoring we do with our graduate software developer is **profession or trade mentoring**. 

A profession or trade mentor is someone who is currently in the profession the mentee is entering. That person knows the trends, important changes and new practices that the mentee should know to stay at the top of their career and helps guide them through these things. 

While the definition of a profession or trade mentor is close, I doesn't fully resonate with me so I'm going to create yet another a form of mentorship to the array that already exists which I call  **Technical Mentorship** (gasp).

### What is technical mentoring?

So what is technical mentoring? I'm going to propose a definition...

Technical mentoring is a process for the informal transmission of knowledge, skills, and support perceived by the recipient as relevant to their development as a software professional; it entails informal communication, usually face-to-face and during a sustained period of time, between the person who is perceived to have greater relevant knowledge, wisdom, and technical skills (the mentor) and a person who is perceived to have less (the protégé)"*.

> Technical mentoring is a process for the informal transmission of knowledge, skills, and support between the mentor and the protege relevant to their development as a software professional 

### Technical mentoring is a role, not a tool

Technical mentorship is a role, not a tool or technique. Let me explain the difference. In the English language we often use the same words to describe both roles and tools. For instance "coaching" is a role and a tool, if you are the coach of a soccer team that is your role and we could say you are coaching them; if you are coaching someone through making a difficult decision, that's a tool you are using to help achieve an outcome (them gaining insights to make a decision by you asking probing questions).. 

While technical mentorship is a role, there are are various tools and techniques technical mentors use to be effective. What tools they use largely depends on their experience and where their mentee is at in their learning journey. 

Some of the tools/techniques I've seen include:

## Why is technical mentoring so powerful

Now that we've established what technical mentorship is, I want to spend a few moments around why technical mentoring is so powerful.

I believe there are a number of attributes that make it powerful, three that immediately stand out to me are context, timing and human connection.

**Context** is essential for us to learn effectively. Understanding why we are learning what we are learning is important for us to remember it. Many other forms of learning (blogs, books, online tutorials) can tell us why in general something is important but aren't able to understand our specific context and relate it back to us. Mentors are able to understand and give context.

**Timing** is just as important as context. Our brains are wired to [forget things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve), especially if they are not relevant to what we are doing right now. Great technical mentors focus on things relevant to our current challenges. The are able to sequence learning and conversations to keep things relevant.

**Human connection**. We learn best through **social interactions** from people we feel connected to. Technical mentoring done right forms a human connection between mentor and mentee that enhances the learning experience.

## How do we get better at it

Now that I have briefly outlined what technical mentoring is and some of the reasons on why it is so powerful, I want to share some things we've learned around how to be better at it. I am going to focus on this specifically around technical mentorship, I've made a [seperate post](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/General-mentoring-suggestions) around general mentoring suggestions. 

I'm going to focus on mentoring software developers who are new in their career...for example, graduate software developers. This is important because the nature of how someone is mentored changes as they grow in experience and capability.  

<img class="img-responsive" alt="Dreyfus Model" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/mentoring-software-developers-dreyfus-model.gif">

I find the Dreyfus model of skills acquisition a useful model to use when adjusting your mentoring approach. I put graduate software developers at the Novice or Advanced Beginner stage in most areas of competency. That means when I mentor a graduate software developer I'm going to focus more on providing them detailed step by step instructions or simple projects in a safe to fail environment and less on contextualized conversations.

## Map out the direction you are heading 

* What does the journey look like, why do we want you to go through this
* Mentors that connected the current learning to the why had happier mentees

## Learn how to teach effectively

* What do adult learners need

* Sinners model

### Learn how to scaffold effectively


## Kata's are useful but can get boring

## Looking at code is often better than talking about code

First establish where someone is. If you don't you risk either them getting no value, or being stretched too much.

* Sinner's model - comfort, learning & panic. What out of what we have are they comfortable doing? How can you validate this?
* Zone of proximal development (where are they right now, what can they do on their own)

## Pair programming is a powerful way to transfer knowlege

* If you are going to pair, have your mentee at the keyboard

Benefits of synthetic problems
* Idea of toy problems to learn new concepts. These are useful to allow you to reduce the pieces of new information being learnt and redundant information
* Falls in line with cognitive load theory

Cons of synthetic problems
* Wax on wax off without connecting to why it is important
* See this as not adding value
* Hippocampi tells you it's not important to learn and so you forget it quickly

## Understanding motivation leads to a better experience

* People enjoy the work more, something invigorating about adding value and building stuff others will use

Cons of real problems
* Complex, often has too many things you need to understand
* Touch area on what you are actually learning can be low

## Resist the technology as long as possible

We introduced quorum reviews where a group of mentors go together to review a particular milestone
* Saw increase in focus of mentees to cover that material
* Higher engagement during this time
* Understanding motivation (share story about drawing pictures and demotivating)

We are currently using a mixed approach where they balance time between real world systems and synthetic problems. It has it's pro's and it's cons.

## Before you code something, have them explain it on a whiteboard 


## There is no secret formula

Unfortunately there is no formula. Every person is different and so the approach taken needs to be customized

The power behind effective mentors is they adapt to the needs of their mentee. The more tools a mentor has, the more able they are to adapt to their mentees needs
