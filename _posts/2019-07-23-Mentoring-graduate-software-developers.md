At MYOB we've been improving our graduate programme for software developers. Today I would like to share some of the insights we've gained over the last few years around a practice I call technical mentorship.

## How do I fit in

I have a software development background with a strong value placed on XP principles. For the last few years I've been guiding our graduate software developer academy at MYOB. The academy is where we employ less experienced software practitioners and through a structured learning and mentorship programme intentionally grow their capability. I cover a bit around the evolution of the structure of the programme in a [previous post](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/Evolving-graduate-programme-for-software-developers).

## Mentorship is a key pillar 

Mentorship is a key pillar in the programme. Certainly our graduates would not learn and grow as effectively as they do if we didn't have amazing dedicated mentors.  

### What does mentorship mean?

As I discovered early on, the word mentorship is a loaded word. It means vastly different things to different people. If you read the [definition on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship) it says: *"Mentoring is a process that always involves communication and is relationship-based, but its precise definition is elusive."*. 

> Mentoring(s)... precise definition is elusive

I fully agree with the precise definition of mentorship being elusive. From what I have found there are many different forms of mentorship. Having looked at the ones listed on wikipedia, the closest form of mentoring to the type of mentoring we do with our graduate software developer is **profession or trade mentoring**. 

A profession or trade mentor is someone who is currently in the profession the mentee is entering. That person knows the trends, important changes and new practices that the mentee should know to stay at the top of their career and helps guide them through these things. 

While the definition of a profession or trade mentor is close, I doesn't fully resonate with me so I'm going to create yet another a form of mentorship to the array that already exists which I call  **Technical Mentorship** (gasp).

### What is technical mentoring?

So what is technical mentorin? I'm going to propose a defitinion...

Technical mentoring is a process for the informal transmission of knowledge, skills, and support perceived by the recipient as relevant to their development as a software professional; it entails informal communication, usually face-to-face and during a sustained period of time, between the person who is perceived to have greater relevant knowledge, wisdom, and technical skills (the mentor) and a person who is perceived to have less (the protégé)"*.

### Technical mentoring is a role, not a tool

Technical mentorship is a role, not a tool or technique. In the English language we seem often use the same words to describe both roles and tools (for instance coaching is a role and a tool, if you are coaching a soccer team that is your role; if you are coaching someone through making a difficult decision, that's a tool--sooaa confusing!).

> Mentoring is a process for the informal transmission of knowledge, social capital, and the psychosocial support...




There are are various tools/techniques I've seen technical mentors use. What to use largely depends on where your mentee is at in their learning journey. Some of the tools/techniques I've seen include:

### What does a great software developer look like?

If you asked me this question a few years ago



1) Are they good at problem solving, given a lot of unknowns can they navigate their way through to a solution
2) Domain Modelling. Are they able to conceptualize a domain and handle how behaviour and data
3) Knowledge Representation. Can they represent knowledge effectively so it is easy to consume
4) Abstraction / modularity - Can they think at different levels, are they able to think abstractly about a problem and then give concrete examples of abstract concepts
5) Novelty / creativity - Can they look at a problem in different angles
6) Categorization - Can they categorize things, group them
7) Communication skills with experts in other domains - Can they communicate with other effectively, verbal, written, etc.
8) Adoption of good practices in software engineering - Do they have great software engineering practices
9) Ability to collaborate with others - Can they build up on others ideas

Right now we look for candidates that show an apptitude for already...

1) Adding to our culture
2) Good good at problem solving
3) Able to represent knowledge well
4) Have basic abstraction / modularity skills
5) Are creative problem solvers
6) Have good communication skills

We look at developing their software engineering practices
We are still figuring out how to look at collaboration skills, or effectively develop these

## Our program at a high level

* Two parts, Acceleration & Crew Rotations
* Acceleration develop foundational skills necessary across most teams
* Crew rotations more traditional, people work in teams

## Have a direction you are heading and help them understand why something is important

* What does the journey look like, why do we want you to go through this
* Mentors that connected the current learning to the why had happier mentees

## Establish ground rules upfront

* Knowing when and how often you will meet with your mentee
* What do they value
* Logistics, how often are you going to meet, what do you expect
* What are you aiming at
* When will this end, what is the journey like

## Establish current skill set

* Sinner's model - comfort, learning & panic. What out of what we have are they comfortable doing? How can you validate this?

Sometimes mentees confused knowledge with skill. Knowledge is to know how to do something, skill would be to be able to actually do it.

* Came across blooms taxonomy of learning. Knowledge is the bottom rung. We are wanting to get them to the apply level where they could use information to solve other problems

* Zone of proximal development (where are they right now, what can they do on their own)

## Balance synthetic problems vs real world problems

Benefits of synthetic problems
* Idea of toy problems to learn new concepts. These are useful to allow you to reduce the pieces of new information being learnt and redundant information
* Falls in line with cognitive load theory

Cons of synthetic problems
* Wax on wax off without connecting to why it is important
* See this as not adding value
* Hippocampi tells you it's not important to learn and so you forget it quickly

Benefits of real problems
* People enjoy the work more, something invigorating about adding value and building stuff others will use

Cons of real problems
* Complex, often has too many things you need to understand
* Touch area on what you are actually learning can be low

We introduced quorum reviews where a group of mentors go together to review a particular milestone
* Saw increase in focus of mentees to cover that material
* Higher engagement during this time
* Understanding motivation (share story about drawing pictures and demotivating)

We are currently using a mixed approach where they balance time between real world systems and synthetic problems. It has it's pro's and it's cons.

## What are the tools available to mentors

* Teacher, I will help you learn concepts and information that you can use to solve problems
* Learning Pairer, we will solve this together and learn from each other while doing it
* Strong Direction, I will tell you what to do to solve it
* Technical advisor, I will answer your questions as you go along
* Modeller, I will do it,  you watch me so you can learn from me
* Coaching (sounding board), I will ask great questions and you will reflect and realize the next steps on your own
* Connector, I don't know myself, but I will introduce you to people that can help you solve this.


## There is no secret formula

Unfortunately there is no formula. Every person is different and so the approach taken needs to be customized

The power behind effective mentors is they adapt to the needs of their mentee. The more tools a mentor has, the more able they are to adapt to ther mentees needs
