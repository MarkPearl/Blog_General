Before mob programming, getting the best of everyone into all the code was tough. It's been something I have chased for over a decade.

The first thing I tried was code standards documents - I started with a template I took off the internet based on the programming language my team was using at the time. It was a thick comprehensive document that outlined all the do's and dont's of naming and structure - I made some personal adjustments, it didn't take more than a few days. The problem was, code standards documents get long very quickly. As we moved from system to system we encountered new technologies, discovered new approaches, learn't new techniques. Very soon I realized I couldn't cover everything in my coding standards documents, and that the maintenance of the document was impractical.

To rub salt in the wound, I soon discovered that likelihood that everyone would read and stay up to date with my standards document diminished by an order of magnitude for every page I added to it and that when people did read it, they often understand it differently to what I had intended. So while people may have thought that they where compliant with the standards, they often were doing something totally different to what I had intended them to do.

Well,
