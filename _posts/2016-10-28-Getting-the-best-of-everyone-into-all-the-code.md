### Before mob programming this was tough

Before mob programming, getting the best of everyone into all the code was tough. It's been something I chased for over a decade.

#### Problem with code standards documents

Early on in my career I tried using a code standards documents as a mechanism to avoid 'bad' code - I started with a standards document I found off the internet (it seemed perfect, it was based on the programming language my team was using at the time and appeared to be quite comprehensive). It was a thick document that outlined all the do's and dont's of naming and structure and what to do in special circumstances. I of course made some personal adjustments based on my own stylistic preferences, it didn't take more than a few days, and asked my team to adopt these standards going forward. 

The problem I soon discovered was that code standards documents get very long very quickly. As I moved from system to system I encountered new technologies, discovered new approaches and learnt better ways of doing things. Very soon my coding standards document was getting fairly thick and the maintenance of it was becoming impractical.

To rub salt in the wound, I soon discovered that not everyone was reading and staying up to date with my standards document. It seemed that for every page I added to the document, the likelihood of people reading it dropped by an order of magnitude. When people did read it, they often understand it differently from what I had originally intended. While people thought they where compliant, often they were not.

#### Problem with code reviews

No problem, I can solve this with code reviews. I'll simply review all of my teams code and make sure they follow my standard. Turns out this can very quickly become a full time job. With just 4 developers I was doing code reviews all day and not writing any code myself. 

Let's share this this responsibility across the team I thought. Instead of me reviewing everyone's code, as someone completes a feature, they should find someone else in the team to review their code.This was an improvement to just the standards document. The code seemed to be getting better. I was however still seeing varying quality in the quality of the code and also observing some interesting people dynamics. 

For instance, certain developers preferred other developers to review their code. These "review marriages" resulted in varying standards between groups. In addition, because the reviews were only being done post the feature being written often there was a ton of code to review. Working under tight time constraints 

, there were vastly varying standards on the quality of the review being done, and what an appropriate standard was.
