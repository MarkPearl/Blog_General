## Vim Settings ##

There are several different levels that you can persist your vim settings, which include:  

- System wide configuration **/etc/vimrc**  
- User configuration **~/.vimrc**  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Vim Modes ##

- [Normal Mode](#NormalMode), **Navigation and manipulation of text**  
- Insert Mode, **Inserting new text**  
- Visual Mode, **Navigation and manipulation of text selections**  
- Select Mode, **Similar to visual, but with more MS Windows-like behavior**  
- Last Line / Command Line Mode, **For entering editor commands**  
- Ex-mode, **Similar to command line mode but optimized for batch processing**  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Clipboard ##

### Setting Vim to use General Clipboard in Linux ###

When installing a new linux version, often the general clipboard register in vim ("*) does not work with the general system clipboard.

One way to determine if your version of vim supports X which is required for general clipboard support is to type the following in bash :  

~~~
vim --version | grep clip
~~~

If you have a version that supports clipboard, you will see  

~~~
+clipboard
~~~

If you do not have a version that supports it, you will see  

~~~
-clipboard
~~~

In which case you can fix this by reinstalling vim as vim-gtk  

~~~
sudo apt-get install vim-gtk
~~~

You then need to set in your vim rc that the clipboard should work with your general system clipboard. You can do this by having the following in your vimrc  

~~~
set clipboard=unnamed
~~~

If you open up vim and type the following command you will see the clipboard setting.  

~~~
set clipboard?
~~~
