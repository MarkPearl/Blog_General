How many times has someone who has been recently introduced to design patterns felt the need to make all their code going forward use a recognized pattern.

In my experience, design patterns often:

* introduce unnecessary complexity, 
* give people a false sense that they have done a good job and followed "best practices"
* inflate the solution

That's why we don't like design patterns!
