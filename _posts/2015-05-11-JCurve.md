#### General ####

The J-Curve Effect is used in a number of fields to describe unrelated things. In this post I refer to the J-Curve effect as the rate of performance when a new process or practice is learn't. When learning something new, there will be an initial dip in performance while the thing is being learn't. As an individual begins to understand and master the thing, time performance will improve, eventually reaching the level it was before the new practice was adopted and then continuing to grow and exceed it.
