#### What prompted juggling ####

A few weeks ago [Daniel Irvine](https://twitter.com/d_ir) spent a day with our team. Daniel is a software craftsman working at [8th Light's](https://8thlight.com/) UK offices. One of the reasons for the visit was to give Daniel a feel for the culture we have at [Driven](http://drivenalliance.com/) and to give us a feel for the culture of 8th Lighters. As a parting gift, Daniel gave us 3 [hacky sacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacky_Sack) - at 8th Light something they do is juggle - apparently it's a thing.

Prior to Daniel's visit I had heard on the radio of several benefits associated with learning to juggle and neural development. At the time I had thought it sounded interesting, but had never seriously considered attempting to become a juggler myself. Prompted by Daniel's gift, I decided to give it a go. 

#### Learning Approach ####

The learning approach would be simple - in our team many of my colleagues are serious coffee drinkers - I don't drink coffee and in the past have often skipped the 'coffee breaks'. I have felt that I've been missing on important social interactions by not participating in this ritual. To kill two birds with one stone I scheduled my juggle 'learning' to be in sync with the coffee breaks. When the team goes for a 'coffee break', I go with them and practice juggling. This gives me a cadence to learn and an opportunity to be more social.

#### The Experience ####

The first two days of juggling were tough. At best I could juggle three hacky's for a few seconds. It felt awkward. After day two I decided I needed some professional help and turned to the internet for tips on how to speed up the learning process. The best instructions I got were:

1) Keep your arms at your side  
2) Throw with your arms, not your wrists   
3) Throw the balls starting from your waist to just above your eyes at a constant height  
4) Stand with your back to a wall when starting to encourage throwing up instead of forwards  

Armed with a basic strategy I continued my daily routine. The team goes for coffee roughly twice a day, and making coffee takes about ten minutes, which meant I was getting 20 minutes of practice a day. Twenty minutes doesn't sound like much, but when repeated every day it is sufficient.

By the end of week one I had improved from a few seconds of continuous juggling to about 20 seconds with 3 hacky's. I began to find enjoyment in getting the basics right. I was also finding something strangely fulfilling in being able to do this simple task (having never considered myself one with great hand / eye coordination for small objects I was amazed I could get this far). 

Week two has led to further improvements. I've adjusted my routine so that I spend a few minutes every couple of hours juggling. It's proven to be a great way to relax and re-focus at the same time - something I would really recommend doing between pomodoro's (if you are that type of person). 

I can now juggle for about a minute without difficulty - each day I am seeing improvement. I'm becoming more conscious of my technique and trying to remove any gremlins that will hinder me down the road.

#### Summary ####

So, has learning to juggle improved my brain powers? I don't know. Research says that if I continue down this road it may do so. Right now I'm just enjoying learning something new. I would really recommend you try juggling. Apparently it's a thing!
