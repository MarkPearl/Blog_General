A few weeks ago [Daniel Irvine](https://twitter.com/d_ir) spent a day with our team. Daniel is a software craftsman working at [8th Light's](https://8thlight.com/) UK offices. One of the reasons for the visit was to give Daniel a feel for the culture we have at [Driven](http://drivenalliance.com/) and to give us a feel for the culture of 8th Lighters. As a parting gift, Daniel gave us 3 [hacky sacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacky_Sack) - at 8th light something they do is juggle - apparently it's a thing. 

Prior to Daniel's visit I had heard on the radio of benefits associated with learning to juggle and neural development. At the time I had thought it sounded interesting, but had never seriously considered attempting to become a juggler myself. Prompted by Daniel's gift, I decided to give juggling a go. The learning approach would be simple - in our team many of my colleagues are serious coffee drinkers - I don't drink coffee, but to schedule juggle 'learning' in, when the team goes for a coffee 'break', I would go with them and practice juggling while they make coffee.


The first two days of juggling were tough. At best I could juggle three hacky's for a few seconds. It felt awkward. After day two I decided I needed some professional help and turned to the internet for tips on how to speed up the learning process. Armed with a basic strategy, I continued my daily routine. The team roughly goes for coffee twice a day, and making coffee takes about ten minutes, which meant I was getting 20 minutes a day of practice. Twenty minutes doesn't sound like much, but when repeated every day it proved to be sufficient.

By the end week one, I had improved from a few seconds to about 20 seconds of continous juggling with 3 hacky's. I began to find enjoyment in getting the basics right. I was also finding something strangely fulfilling in being able to do this simple task - having never considered myself one with great hand / eye coordination for small objects. 

Week two has led to further improvements. I've adjusted my routine so that I spend a few minutes every couple of hours juggling. It's proven to be a great way to relax and re-focus at the same time - something I would really recommend doing between pomodoro's (if you are that type of person). I can now juggle for about a minute without difficulty. I'm becomming more conscious of my technique and trying to remove any gremlins that will hinder me down the road.

So, has learning to juggle improved my brain powers? I don't know. Research says that if I continue down this road it may do so. Right now I'm just enjoying learning something new. I would really recommend you try juggling.
