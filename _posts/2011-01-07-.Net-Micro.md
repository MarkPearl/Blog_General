A while back I purchased a RFID scanner that could be connected to a PC and programmed via VS. It was a fun purchase an though the import duties nailed me, I was glad to get the little gadget.

Last night while listening to .Net Rocks I heard of another company that sells similar components for .Net Micro.

Check out their websitesâ€¦.
