I'm passionate about learning. It's something that part of my day to day activities. Many years ago I watched a talk (I can't remember which one) that spoke about the need for software organisations to be learning organisations. The permise was that as knowledge workers, actively increasing knowledge was essential to staying ahead of the curve. It resonated with me at the time. Since then, I've always strived to create teams and a culture that actively learn and grow. 

One example was a team I lead that I'll call in this post my "learning team". As the leader of this team I wanted to create a learning environment. To do this I promised the team that one day a week we would spend on improvement, a combination of team led learning activities and individual learning activities. We carved out dedicated time each week we called learning time. I gave freedom to each individual to pick what they wanted to learn. Over time I noticed that people focused on things they were passionate about. Some used the time to learn new programming languages, others spent time learning new technologies, others process and so on. As the leader, I felt mission accomplished. We had created a learning culture. Looking back I got it wrong. 

The ultimate purpose of my role in that team was to increase the sustainable output of the team. While creating a learning enviornment could lead to increased output, it also may not. It depended on two factors. What people were learning, and if they were able to practically apply that learning. Learning for the sake of learning provided little value. 

What you learn is important. You need to start with what is foundational for your current role and contributions to the team. In my learning team I had people who had still not mastered their core skills learning things on the fringe of their role. For example, I had one person learning random C# libraries when he could still not produce basic clean testable basic C# code. He was learning a fringe topic. What you learn is important.

The second aspect is the ability to apply the knowledge to increase performance. Being driven to accomulate knowledge that does not lead to increased performance is a waste of time. I've worked with people who are extremely knowledgable but when given an opportunity to produce things they are unable to do it effectively. That knowledge is waste. 

As a leader I've moved from creating an enviornment where accumultaing knowledge is valued, to creating an envionrment where learning is motivated to produce tangible improved results is an important paradigm shift.
