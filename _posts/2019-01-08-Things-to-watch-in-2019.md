Each year I put a list of things I believe are worth reading and watching in the year. 

See past years: [2018](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/Things-to-watch-in-2018),[2017](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/Things-to-read-and-watch-in-2017),[2016](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/Things-To-Read-And-Watch-in-2016)  

Here is my list for 2019. This list is adapted as the year progresses:
