I occaisonally get asked where a lot of the concepts I have embraced in software development come from. For those that are serious about getting a deeper understanding of the process of software development I would recommend reading books. Reviews of some of the books I've read can can be found on my [book reviews blog](http://bookreviews.markpearl.co.za/). 

For those that say they do not have time to read books... shame on you! That said, I have listed the top 5 conference talks that I have seen this year (note, I saw these videos this year, it doesn't mean they were presented this year). If you find these videos inspiring people, you will find the speakers have written books that explore these and related topics in a little more depth.
