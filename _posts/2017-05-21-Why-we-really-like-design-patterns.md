How often have you opened up a solution to see a clean separation of concerns, with clear use of creational, behavioural and structual patterns. How about when you had a conversation with a colleague who is not familiar with the code base - design patterns enable a conversation, "here are our factories, here we have leveraged a singleton". All of a sudden conceptualising what is going on is so much easier, you have a common terminology for discussing design situaitons and decisions.

For this reason we love design patterns.
