#### Six Things to Help Improve Self-Control ####

1. Meditate.  
2. Eat slow release foods (avoid sugar or glucose spikes).  
3. Exercise.
4. Get enough sleep.  
5. Ride the wave. Wait for a period of time before giving in. Desire has a tendency to ebb and flow like the tide.  
6. Forgive yourself. Be aware how mistakes make you feel, but don't wallow in those feelings. Focus on what you are going to do differently next time.
