Recently we've been working on team models. To make it more explicit on why we do things, we worked on calling out the underlying principles we used in putting the model together. These are what we recorded...

* People managers cannot effectively manage more than 5-7 people
* Reduce cognitive load by establishing clear domain boundaries along value streams
* It takes longer to find and hire leadership than it takes to find and hire individual contributors
* Optimising for delivery consistency, ie. flow of work
* We value discovery work so that we build the right thing (understanding before execution)
* The minimum delivery unit is the product delivery team
* We value practice leadership in order to build a high quality product
* Product delivery teams have a balance of skills (software engineering, analysis, design, etc.)
* Product delivery teams need appropriate support (architecture, tech writers, etc.)
