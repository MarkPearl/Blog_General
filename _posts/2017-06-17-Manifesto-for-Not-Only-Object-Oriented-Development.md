*Originally this was stored on [http://notonlyoo.org/](http://notonlyoo.org) however the sites seems to be down and because I believe it's valuable I've replicated it here...*

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

* **Functions & Types** over classes  
* **Purity** over mutability  
* **Composition** over inheritance  
* **Higher-order** functions over method dispatch  
* **Options** over nulls

That is, while there is value in the items on the right (except for nulls), we value the items on the left more!

*If you do not know what any of the above are and you are doing development, I would recommend finding them out*
