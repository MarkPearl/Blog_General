Two main types of meetings:
1) Process oriented meetings 
2) Mission oriented meetings

## Process oriented meetings

Attributes:
Reguarly scheduled
Knowledge is shared and information exchanged
It should allow managers to batch information (being able to exchange information in one bulk go instead of dripping it out)

People attending should:
* know how the meeting is run
* know what types of things are discussed
* know what is to be accomplished

Types of process oriented meetings:
* One-on-ones
* Staff meetings
* Operation reviews

## Mission oriented meetings

Attributes:
Purpose is to produce a decision
Usually held adhoc and designed to produce specific output
Usualy one person has more at stake on the outcome than others (often the person organising the meeting)

People attending should:
* know the purpose of the meeting in advance
* know what value they add to the purpose
* know what the format of the meeting is
* know who will faciliate the meeting (the organiser)

When a mission oriented meeting fails to accomplish the purpose for which it was called, the blame belongs to the organiser

If you are organising this type of meeting, ask yourself: "What am I trying to accomplish", then ask: "Is a meeting necessary, or desireable, or justifiable?. Don't call a meeting if all the answers aren't yes.

Tips:
* Put a dollar cost on the meeting based on the rate per hour of each person attending, be sure the cost is worth the outcome
* Keep these meetings small, no more than 6 or 7 people. Meetings with more than this are hard to make a decision.

Organiser is responsible for maintianing discipline. Wasting time in this meeting means you are wasting company money.

Organiser should be responsible for the agenda and logistics. Basic agenda includes: purpose of meeting, format of meeting, when it should happen
