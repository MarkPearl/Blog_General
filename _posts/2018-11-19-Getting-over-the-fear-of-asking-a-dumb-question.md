title: Getting over the fear of asking a dumb question

I recently wrote about [asking questions](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/Asking-questions). On a similar vein of thought a common characteristic I see with inexperienced professional software developers is the fear to ask the "dumb" question. 

What I've found is usually not asking the question is worse than asking it. For instance, I remember having a graduate developer in my team once who rarely said anything in team discussions but kept a notebook and would regularly write things down in them. On some probing I discovered he was writing down key words from conversations and then staying up all night researching those topics so he could become an "expert" in them.  The problem with this approach was many of the topics were fringe topics that you didn't need to have an in depth knowledge on - his nights were being wasted away on learning the wrong things. What was taking many hours of researching on his own could have been accelerated by a 2 minute conversation at the whiteboard with someone who had knowledge in that area and was aware of the blind spots he had!

So what causes this fear? It's definitely multifaceted. Some of the facets include:  

1. You open yourself up too potential negative responses if the person you are asking is a jerk  
2. You want to be seen as a contributor and as someone who "gets it" and asking the question may loose the credibility you desire  
3. You see everyone around you as experts on everything

## Seeing everyone around you as an expert

Often they see everyone around them as an expert on everything, represented in the diagram above on the left. The reality is we all have our niches of expertise but are not experts in everything so our knowledge is more like the diagram on the right. 

We know that, we know that others around us are experts in other things and so we are comfortable asking the "experts" the "novice" questions.

## Why

Yes, there needs to be some thought put behind the question but often  Asking the "dumb" questions is a great way to accelerate your learning and fill in the gaps quickly.

So, if you are mentoring someone how do you get them to be comfortable to ask questions sooner?

One approach is to help them change their mindset on where we are all at. 


One approach I've heard is to reverse roles.
