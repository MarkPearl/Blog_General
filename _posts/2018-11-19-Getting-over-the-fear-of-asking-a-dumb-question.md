title: Getting over the fear of asking a dumb question

I recently wrote about [asking questions](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/Asking-questions). On a similar vein of thought a common characteristic I see with inexperienced professional software developers is the fear to ask the "dumb" question. 


I suspect that the fear is caused because of a few things:

1. They open themselves up too potential negative responses if the person they are asking is a jerk  
2. They want to be seen as a contributor and as someone who "gets it" and asking the question may loose them credibility in this area 
3. They see everyone around them as experts on everything

Often they see everyone around them as an expert on everything. The reality is we all have our niches of expertise but are not experts in everything. We know that, we know that others around us are experts in other things and so we are comfortable asking the "experts" the "novice" questions.

What I've found is usually not asking the question is worse than asking it. Yes, there needs to be some thought put behind the question but often what can takes many hours of researching on your own can be accelerated by a 2 minute conversation at the whiteboard with someone who has knowledge in that area. Asking the "dumb" questions is a great way to accelerate your learning and fill in the gaps quickly.

So, if you are mentoring someone how do you get them to be comfortable to ask questions sooner?

One approach is to help them change their mindset on where we are all at. 


One approach I've heard is to reverse roles.
