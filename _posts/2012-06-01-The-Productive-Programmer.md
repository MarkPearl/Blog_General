This book has a combination of tips and tricks for utilities as well as general practices. The tips and tricks are mostly outdated and did not add any real value. The practices I found useful and worth reading. 

I would put the Pragmatic Programmer ahead of this book, then this book in a joint second with The Passionate Programmer and taking up the tail end would be The Developers Code.
