### Aim

To share responsibilities across a group so that nobody does excessively more work than others.

### How it works

- Each time you do the ‘opening facilitation’ you get a dot next to your name.
- The person with the least dot’s next to their name is the opening facilitator for the next session.
- If more than one person has the ‘least’ dots next to their name (a tie) we revert to alphabetical order (A-Z) between those people.
 

   Name   	| A 	| B 	| C 	| D 	| E 	| F 	| G 	
----------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------
 Person 1 	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	
 Person 2 	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	
 Person 3 	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	
 Person 4 	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|
