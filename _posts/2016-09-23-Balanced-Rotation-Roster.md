### Aim

To share responsibilities across a group so that nobody does excessively more work than others.

### How it works

- Each time you have your turn you get a dot next to your name.
- The person with the least dot’s next to their name has their turn next.  
- If more than one person has the ‘least’ dots next to their name (a tie) we revert to alphabetical order (A-Z) between those people.

### Worked Example

Using the above roster, it would be Person 2 turn next. This is because Person 2 & Person 4 have the 'least' number of dots next to their name. Alphabetically Person 2 comes before Person 4.
