## Chapter 3

### Brocolli in your teeth

We call this area PQ for personality quotient. It is your ability to become self-aware. A strong PQ allows people to ask others what it is like to be on the other side of them. PQ is actually a mirror. When you really look at yourself in a mirror you may find that you have broccoli in your teeth that no one has told you about. And we all have broccoli in our teeth. The bits of broccoli are the things about us that annoy other people the most.
