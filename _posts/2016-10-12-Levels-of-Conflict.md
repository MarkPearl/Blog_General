### Level 1 - Problem to Solve

- Everyday frustrations and aggravations  
- People have different opinions, misunderstanding may have happened  
- Conflicting goals or values  

#### Words used

- Clear, specific, and factual   
- Language is on the now, not talking about the past   
- People check in with one another if they think a miscommunication has just happened   
- It's not comfortable, but it's not emotionally charged either  

### Level 2 - Disagreement

- Self-protection becomes as important as solving the problem  
- People distance themselves from one another  
- People talk offline with other people to test strategies or seek advice and support  
- Good natured joking moves toward half-joking barb  
- Nastiness gets a sugarcoating but still comes across as bitter  
- People are wary  

#### Words used

- Language moves from specific to general  
- Don't share all you know about the issues  

### Level 3 - Contest

- Aim is to win  
- Compounding effect occurs as prior conflict and problems remain unresolved  
- Multiple issues cluster into larger issues or create a "cause"  
- People begin to aling themselves with one side or the other  
- Emotions become tools used to "win" supporters for one's position  
- Problems and people become synonymous  
- Language becomes distorted  

### Level 4 - Crusade

- Resolving the situation isn't good enough  
- You may believe the only option is to remove the others from the team or get removed from the team
- Factions become entrenched and can solidify
- People and positions are seen as one
- Overall attitude is righteous and punitive

### Level 5 - World War

- Destroy!  
- It's not enough that one wins, others must lose  
- No constructive outcome can be had

## Things to do

- Feel the energy in the room  
- Focus on language
