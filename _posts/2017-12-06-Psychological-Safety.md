## Psychological safety exists when...

* You can be yourself  
* You can take risks  
* You can make mistakes  
* You can raise problems  
* You can ask questions  
* You can disagree  

## What shapes our willingness to speak up?

* Fear of being seen as ignorant  
* Fear of being seen as incompetent  
* Fear of being seen as negative  
* Fear of being seen as disruptive  
* Feeling futile (said it before and nobody has done anything on it)  

## Four horseman get in the way of breaking the cycle of distrust

1. Criticism   
2. Contempt   
3. Defensiveness  
4. Stonewalling
