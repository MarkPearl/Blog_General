Lead time:  How long it takes between the time you get a request and you finish it

#### How does it help ####

The lead time is important to understand because that's the perceived time it takes from your customer.  As an example, if you order a burger at a restaurant, and the order sits in the queue for 5 minutes before it is prepared, and it takes another 10 minutes to prepare, from the customers perspective the burger took 15 minutes.  However from the cooks perspective, it only took 10 minutes.  You can think of these as internal and external perceptions of measuring throughput.
