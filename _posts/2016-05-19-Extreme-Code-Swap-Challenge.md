I am a fan of code retreats. There is so much to get from them, from the different pairings to the different constraints on each session, to just meeting different people. Today I want to mention of an exercise I came up with inspired by code retreat's. It's a ton of fun, can be done in under 40 minutes and will give you some insights into the quality of the code you right as a team. I call it the Extreme Code Swap Challenge.

### Vanilla Code Swap ###

#### What you need ####

A small group of developers with an equal number of developer stations (3-5).   
Identical development lanugage and IDE (or ones that everyone is comfortable) on all machines.  

#### How it works ####

- A common kata is picked for the exercise.  
- Each developer starts at their machine and is given 5 minutes to solve the kata.  
- As the time lapses someone calls time and everyone gets up from their machine and rotates to the next workstation.  
- Rotations are done blind - meaning when you come to a new workstation you cannot speak to the developer that was there before - you can only rely on the code.  
- After sufficient rotations we stop, have a mini-retro where everyone gets together to share the experiences and what is frustrating them etc.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Variations ###

#### 1 Minute Feedback Rotation ####

A slight variation on this is that when you hit a rotation point, you are allowed 1 minute to explain to the person coming in where you were going with the solution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Learnings from the exercise ###

Some of the learnings I got from the exerise:  
- Initially there seems to be a fair amount of pressure to 'solve' the problem.  
- After the second rotation you start looking at how you can make things smaller so that people can see the direction you are going.  
- Expressing intent is hard, and the further you get into the problem the easier it is for people to pick things up.  
- Having tests passing helps get intent across, nothing worse than picking up someones solution and no tests are passing.  
- Making the intent clear becomes an important factor.
