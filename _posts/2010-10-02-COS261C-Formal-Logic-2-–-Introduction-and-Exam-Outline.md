Exam Outline
The 2010 Exam will be divided into two sections.

Section A will be multiple choice and count for 24 marks
Section B will be written and count for 76 marks
Examples of Questions from Section A that will have multiple choice answers include…

Given a specific Tarski world and a number of sentences in the block language, you have to establish which of these sentences are not true in the given Tarski world and write down the option indicating that. The world will be specified in a way similar to the worlds given in assignment 1 of 2010
Asked to write down the option giving correct English translation of an FOL sentence in the block language or a correct FOL translation in the block language of an English sentence.
Required to derive a Disjunctive Normal Form or Conjunctive Normal Form of a given FOL sentence (as rough work) and then write down the option given a correct DNF or CNF.
Asked to construct a truth table of an FOL sentence or a single joint truth table of a few FOL sentences and then right down the option giving the correct interpretation of the truth table.
Required to inspect an argument and then write down the option giving the correct evaluation of the argument with respect to soundness and validity.
Section B will have 6 questions, most of which will have subsections. Examples of questions include…

Translating English sentences to first-order logic (FOL) formulas or FOL sentences to English sentences using the predicates and names given in a table in the examination paper.
Establishing whether given arguments are valid or sound and explaining the answers
Giving informal proofs of a valid argument using proof by cases and/or proof by contradiction.
Constructing a counterexample to a given argument.
Giving formal proofs using the rules of natural deduction. For these questions the following is important…

The Fitch System uses these rules
De Morgan’s laws are not part of natural deduction rules
You may not use Taut Con or FO Con or Ana Con
You will find a summary of the rules that you may use on pages 557 to 560 of the textbook.
