Hi all… I need your help to getting me to present at TechEd South Africa. They are having a speaker idol competition where attendees can present short ten minute topics.

I have put a lot of work into preparing my topic, but to get a chance to present, you need to get within the top 6 most popular topics voted. I am presenting on F# Best Practices, and would appreciate your vote if you can spare a fellow GWB blogger a minute.

You can visit the url directly… http://twtpoll.com/tp4dkx

 

You need to put a 10 next to my name – Best Practices in F# (Mark Pearl)

Thanks for your help…
