Today I can finally say that I finished both of my Bill Gates books that had been lying on the shelf for several years. The books were…

The Road Ahead (1995)
Business @ the Speed of Thought (1999)
I enjoyed “The Road Ahead”, purely because it was fun to read about someone looking into the future at technology, while I could read it looking at the past. In fact I was quite impressed with how much he got right and it was also nice to remember “The good old days”.

Business @ the Speed of Thought was a harder read for me. The book still had some good insights, but was tough going at times (possibly because it was several hundred more pages than the first).

All that being said, I can now finally place them back on the shelf knowing that they have been read.
