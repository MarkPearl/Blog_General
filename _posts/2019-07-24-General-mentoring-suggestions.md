### Establish up front how the mentoring relationship is going to work

It seems obvious but I've seen the impact of not establishing this upfront. Some of the things you want to clarify...

* Why do they want you as their mentor
* How often you will meet 
* What are you aiming at
* How will we know when it's over

Knowing the framework for the relationship will avoid some awkward situations. I've seen a mentoring relationship go on for several months longer than it needed to because the mentee didn't know how to tell their mentor they wanted a change.
