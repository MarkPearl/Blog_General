Yesâ€¦ it took me a lot longer than I originally thought it would, but today I hit 1000 points on Stack Overflow.

How did I reach this milestone ;-) Well, initially I started visiting Stack Overflow with the intention of answering as many questions as possible and getting recognized as the answer guru. I soon discovered that there are many people out there that know a lot more than I do, and can type a lot quicker than I can.

So I gave that up and, and have only really been using S/O as a resource when I have gotten stuck. Yes, I felt like an absolute noob asking some of the questions that I did, but I have always been impressed by the quality of the answers I got from various people and how effective the site is!

Hopefully I can reach the next big milestone of 10K points sometime in my lifetime!
