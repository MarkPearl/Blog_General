At the end of your first mob programming session it is important to do a post mob retrospective. This is where everyone who just participated in the mobbing session get's to share how they found the session. Your first post mob retro should not take too long - try keep it under 15 minutes.

## Start with an easy question

Start the retro with an easy question, something that everyone is comfortable commenting on (often once a person makes an initial contribution, you will see them contributing through out the retro).

I like to start witht the question:

> Does the layout work for you?



Things you want to cover in this session include:

1. Does the layout work for everyone
2. Did everyone feel engaged
3. Where there any situations where you felt there was unnecessary friction
