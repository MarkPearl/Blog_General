At the end of your first mob programming session it is important to do a post mob retrospective. This is where everyone who just participated in the mobbing session get's to share how they found it and put forward suggestions on what to change next time. Your first post mob retro should not take too long - try keep it under 15 minutes.

## Start with an easy question

Start the retro with an easy question, something that everyone is comfortable commenting on (often once a person makes an initial contribution, you will see them contributing through out the retro).

I like to start with...

> Did the physical layout work for you?

Encourage people to give feedback. Be comfortable with a few moments of awkward silence. As people give feedback, look out for suggestions and ideas on what to change. If you identify one, write a headline for it on a post-it note.

## Make suggestions visible to the mob

Once a headline is written, put the post-it note in a place where the entire mob can see it. If you have a whiteboard by the mobbing station, often this is a good place to put them. 

In future mob programming sessions, often the same area becomes a place for people in the mob to write suggested topics to discuss at the end of mob session retro.

## Try and get to the heat

Asking about physical layouts, while important, is less important than getting to what I like to call the heat. 

Usually the heat is around how people communicated and interacted during the session.

- Did everyone feel engaged, what stopped you from feeling engaged?
- Where there situations where you felt there was unnecessary friction, why do you think there was this friction?
- Where there situations where you felt you were talking over someone else, what can you do differently next time?

If there is no real heat, or people aren't in a good place to go there, don't push too hard. Mob programming can be extremely tiring, sometimes people just need some time to recover and think. If your mob is in this state, suggest doing a quick retro when the team starts their next mobbing session and close the session.

## Handling suggested adjustments

Before you close the retro, go through all the new suggested ideas and changes. You want to frame these suggestions as 'experiments' - something the mob can try, and if it doesn't work relook at.

Be careful not to adopt too many experiements at once.
