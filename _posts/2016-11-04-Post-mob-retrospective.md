At the end of your first mob programming session it is important to do a post mob retrospective. This is where everyone who just participated in the mobbing session get's to share how they found the session. Your first post mob retro should not take too long - try keep it under 15 minutes.

## Start with an easy question

Start the retro with an easy question, something that everyone is comfortable commenting on (often once a person makes an initial contribution, you will see them contributing through out the retro).

I like to start with...

> Did the physical layout work for you?

Make sure a headline for each suggestions or improvement someone makes is written on a post-it note.

## Put outcomes where the entire mob can see

Put these post-it notes in a place where the entire mob will see during next mob programming session. If you have a whiteboard by the mobbing station, often this is a good place.



## Agree on what to change for the next session




Things you want to cover in this session include:

1. Does the layout work for everyone
2. Did everyone feel engaged
3. Where there any situations where you felt there was unnecessary friction
