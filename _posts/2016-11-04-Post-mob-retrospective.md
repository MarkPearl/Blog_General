At the end of your first mob programming session it is important to do a post mob retrospective. This is where everyone who just participated in the mobbing session get's to share how they found the session and put forward suggestions on what to change in your next session. Your first post mob retro should not take too long - try keep it under 15 minutes.

## Start with an easy question

Start the retro with an easy question, something that everyone is comfortable commenting on (often once a person makes an initial contribution, you will see them contributing through out the retro).

I like to start with...

> Did the physical layout work for you?

Encourage people to give feedback. Be comfortable with a few moments of awkward silence. As people give feedback, look out for suggestions on what to change. If you identify one, write a headline for it on a post-it note.

## Put outcomes where the entire mob can see

Once a headline is written, put the post-it note in a place where the entire mob can it during their next mob programming session. If you have a whiteboard by the mobbing station, often this is a good place to keep them. 

## Establish social rules

Asking about physical layouts, while important, is less important than getting to heat - how people communicated and interacted during the session.

The really interesting questions you want to get to include

- Did everyone feel engaged, what stopped you from feeling engaged?
- Where there situations where you felt there was unnecessary friction, why do you think there was this friction?
- Where there situations where you felt you were talking over someone else, what can you do differently next time?

## Agree on what to change for the next time
