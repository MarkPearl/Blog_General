Whenever advocating change, it helps to understand the mindset of all the people who will be affected by that change. When it comes to looking at agile software development, because I have been a software developer all my life, I have always looked at agile from a 'programmers' mindset.

I recently was reminded that software is not just created by programmers, there are other people that add just as much value to the process that are looking at the problem from a totally different perspective. 

Suggesting a particular approach without keeping in mind these other perspectives is short sighted. One such perspective to keep in mind is that of the Business Analyst.

What are some of the questions a BA has when involved in an agile project:

- What does it mean to have an agile mind-set as a BA? 
- Is the BA Role Agile?  
- What is the BAs Role in Agile Frameworks & Methodologies?  
- Where can the Agile BA add value to the value chain?  
- Where can the BA add value to the organisation that seeks to be agile in structure and approach? 

I have been on numerous “Agile Projects” as a BA and needless to say, the expectation from the BA role has been quite varied. 
The BA role in most agile settings is typically restricted to a “team member” status. What does it mean to be a team member?

#### Do we loose valuable information?  

#### Where do I store my CYA scenarios?

#### Do we do less analysis?
