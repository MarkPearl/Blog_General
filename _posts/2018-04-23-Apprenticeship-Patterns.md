## What does it mean to be an apprentice?  

Overlapping values of craftmanship that stood out to me:

* a growth mindset  
* a need to always be adapting and changing based on the feedback you get from the world around you  
* a desire to be pragmatic rather than dogmatic---a willingness to trade off theoretical purity or future perfection in favor of getting things done today  
* a belief that it is better to share what we know than to create scarcity by hoarding it  
* a willingness to experiment and be proven wrong  
* a dedication t an internal locus of control---taking responsibility for our destinies rather than just waiting for someone else to give us the answers  
* a focus on individuals rather than groups  
* a commitment to inclusiveness. We think a useful system should be able to identify and absorb the best ideas from all elements of the software development community
