Riak uses erlang as a base language. Erlang is a programming language used to build massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability.

OTP is a set of libraries and design principles providing middle-ware to develop erlang based systems.

#### Kerl ####

[Kerl](https://github.com/yrashk/kerl) is a shell agnostic tool that makes it easy to install and build instances of Erlang and Otp.
