> An Optimist is someone who figures that taking a step backward after taking a step forward is not a disaster, it’s more like a cha-cha
 
Biggest challenges in creating change are:
 
1) Afraid I might hurt my reputation/career  
2) My boss is resistant to most new ideas  
3) Unclear how decisions really get mane  
4) My ideas go against the culture of my organization I hate dealing with conflict and controversy  
5) Working through approval processes makes me crazy  
 
### Bad Rebel  
- Complain  
- Me-focussed  
- Pessimist  
- Problems  
- Anger  
- Alienate people  
- Assertions  
- Pinpoint fingers  
- Lecture  
- Worry that  
- Obsessed  

 
### Good Rebel
- Create  
- Mission focused  
- Optimist  
- Possibilities  
- Passion  
- Attract support  
- Questions  
- Pinpoint causes  
- Listen  
- Wonder if  
- Reluctant  

 
### Common Fears
- Assumptions (hold us back)  
- Address your boss’ worries (tailor your ideas to make them look less bad)  

 
### Skills needed
- Communicate to effect behaviour (what’s at stake, what could be, show it can work)
- Prove it can work
- There can be no change without conflict – become comfortable with conflict (learn to listed, ask people what’s in the way, ask for alternatives…)
- Learn how to strategically address bullies
- Frame your idea so people understand what you are talking about
- Don’t go it alone when creating change
- 10% minority rule – when you get 10% of a group to believe in an idea, it becomes a real idea and has a much higher likelihood of being approved
- Understand when decisions are made and how things work and get done
- Make friends with bureaucratic black belts (legal people, etc.)

 
### Self-Care  
- Gratitude  
- Penalty Boxes – if you end up in penalty box for positive intent, know you’ll recover. Use the time to observe, set new strategy  
- Friendships – outside of work friends = priceless to sanity, well-being.  
- Get outside – all adventures are easier when you’re healthy, fit, rested  

 
### When should you quit?  
- Your values are far from your company’s  
- There are no opportunities to grow  
- You’ve burned too many bridges  
- There is no one at work to support you  

 
## 6 reasons bosses say NO
1) It’s just not that important  
2) I can’t understand what the “it” is  
3) Bad timing  
4) Uncertainty makes me nervous  
5) I don’t like the idea and can’t tell you  
6) I love the way things are
