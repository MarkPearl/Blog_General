### The Challenge ###

In the last few years I have discovered that there are software development teams spread across the world that are doing amazing things.

Some of the things I seen in different teams in different organizations over the last few years include:

- teams that have been able to intentionally create amazing team culture.  
- teams that have done unique things to represent the work they do collaboratively.  
- teams that have deep technical skills developed through mentorship or intentional learning.  
- teams that have raised the level of collaboration by pushing the boundaries of mobbing.  
- teams that have figured out how to hire properly.

The challenge I see is that it is all disconnected - there are pockets of brilliance, but very little connecting these islands. We need to fix that!

So how are we currently connecting these pockets of excellence? 

Currently now I see two approaches:

1) Company pays a guru consultant to come and visit and share their insights. The guru spends a few days sharing their wisdom with the team, before moving on to the next team.  
2) Company hires new employees who bring some of the "magic sauce" with them from their previous employers.  

Neither of these approaches are great. The guru is expensive, the hire is permanent and irregular. Both approaches don't encourage regular sharing. 

I've found a better way - we call it "Team Tourism" (although I would love a better name for it).

### What is Team Tourism? ###

Team tourism is the idea that every once in a while we need to get out of our specific team and be a tourist with another team with the intention of openly sharing. The person touring has just as much responsibility in sharing as the team being toured. The aim of team tourism is to create intentional cross pollination between organizations at a higher cadence than currently exists..

#### How does it work? ####

A person visits a team for a period of time. During the visit they learn by participation, since I've done this from a developer perspective this means you join the team, you pair or mob with others, attend stand up, attend retro, etc.

#### Why is this a better way? ####

Open cross pollination at a fraction of the price with no bias - you get to see exactly what and how a different team handles things.

### Practical Implementation ###

At a conceptual level I there is a compelling argument for team tourism - I've put together a few suggestions below that I've found  help make it effective...   

#### How long should a tourist visit? ####

- I've found one to three day's is great. Personally I've found anything less than a day is too short with even one day being a bit overwhelming (especially if you have travelled to get there). My preference is two days which gets to show you some of the routine.

#### To make it possible ####

- Team tourism is not a 'polite' word for poaching staff - for it to work sponsoring companies should not be concerned that their staff will be poached.  
- Companies supporting tourism should consider time spent at another team 'work'. I've tried doing tourism on my on leave, alas it is hard to do when leave with family is so limited anyway.  
- Costs of tourism should be shared between companies. There should be no profit making movtive.

### Interested in having me visit? ###

I love doing tourism days. I've found two things typically hold me back from doing them more frequently.

1) Expenses (Travel & Accomodation)
2) Taking leave

If you would be interested in having me be a tourist at your company shoot me an email and we will see if we can make it happen.
