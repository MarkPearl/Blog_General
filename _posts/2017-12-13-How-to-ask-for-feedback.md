When you work with people that think the way you think you rarely need feedback - you already know what they are thinking. Unfortunately working with people that think the same way you think leads to one dimensional solutions, that's not what we are after. Instead we want to introduce diversity so that we see a problem at multiple angles.

The challenge with diversity is you have to work with people who think and act differently to how you think and act. To be able to work with them effectively you need to actively gather feedback. 

I'm beginning to realize how poor many people are at giving and receiving feedback. Software developers in general are good at talking about solving technical problems with others... but ask them to give and receive feedback to another person about the challenges and nuances they encounter when working together and things dry up...  

Today I want to share some tips about what to get feedback on...

1. Be grateful for any feedback you receive, even if you don't agree with it
2. Ask directly how you come across to them and any adjustments you can make when interacting them 
3. Ask are there any gaps in your interactions that they feel you should focus on

Often people will tell you that they don't have any big issues... if someone tells you this, ask them for a small thing... everyone has something!
