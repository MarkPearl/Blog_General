Team tourism is a process of visiting a team to "make" notes.

#### Comments from Kevin Trethewey on Team Tourism####

Some meta-things I have learned in the process, off the top of my head:  
- I haven't personally found any value in trying to benchmark teams against each other, the variability is just too high between them.   
- A lot of the system that a team is in is not observable, so you have to be careful not to make inferences (confirmation bias)  
- Some cultures are more open than others  
- People learn best from people who are doing similar work to them.  
- If you speak to a manager you will get a manager view of the system.  
- If you speak to a dev you will get a dev view.  
- The difference between a dev and manager view of the system is interesting on it's own and it takes some maturity to sift that.  
- There is a lot of value in just knowing that people in different systems have the same problems as you do.

##### Mechanisms we have tried: #####
- Whiteboard each other's process and discuss  
- Get people to facilitate each other's retrospective. (this of course assumes a retro is in place on both sides)  
- Observe a specific session (planning/demo etc), and give feedback on observations afterwards  
- Spend a day with the team
