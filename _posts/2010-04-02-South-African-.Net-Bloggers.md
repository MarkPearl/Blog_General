Where would I be without the inspiration of the following South African developers who are constantly contributing to the .NET community.

[Robert MacClean](http://sadev.co.za/)  
[Hilton Giesenow](http://hilton.giesenow.com/)  
[Rubi Grobler](http://www.rudigrobler.net/)  
[Zayd Kara](http://zaydkara.spaces.live.com/)  
[Zlatan Dzinic]()  
[Dave Coates](http://pedotnet.blogspot.com/)  

As well as the great input we get from the [local Microsoft people](http://blogs.msdn.com/southafrica/).
