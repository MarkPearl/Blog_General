####  Notes ####

A model that summarises important discoveries about the way people interact socially.

##### 3 Central Ideas #####
- Brain treats many social threats the same as physical threats  
- Capacity to make decisions, solve problems and collaborate is greatly reduced by a threat response and increased under a reward response  
- The threat response is more intense and common and often needs to be carefully minimized in social interactions  

Status - relative importance to others  
Certainty - being able to predict the future  
Autonomy - sense of control over events  
Relatedness - sense of safety with others  
Fairness - perception of fair exchanges between people
