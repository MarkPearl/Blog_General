Graduates will be in your team, their objective is to learn. 
Graduates will also attend the academy once every two weeks, they will get tasks they need to which will take up some of their day  
They learn by doing stuff with you, and by deepening their knowledge of core principles. 
They need to balance learning with you with learning core principles.

If they are spending all their time on delivery items they have the balance wrong
If they are spending all their time on academy work they have the balance wrong

They should be spending one to two hours a day on those tasks. This should be done outside of core team time (meaning retrospectives, stand ups, opportunities to learn on the job)
