# Care about your team

- Great people in the morning, ask how they are doing and care about their answers. 

# Let people be seen and heard

# People have a need to belong

Culture is the backbone of innovation - (Sarah Prevette) - It's not enough to want an innovation culture. You need to be dedicated to hearing honest feedback and championing ideas that your staff have.

* Coercive leaders demand immediate compliance  
* Affiliative leaders create imotional bonds and harmony  
* Democratic leaders build consensus through participation  
* Coaching leaders develop people for the future  
* Authoritative leaders mobilize people toward a vision

# Potential interview questions for a Dev Lead

* Give them a case scenario where the team is stressed and ask them how will they respond to it.
* What have been their previous experience in:
  * Conlict resolution  
  * Building Team culture  

* What have been their failures and what are their learnings from them.
* We want to add someone less experienced as an interviewer. We want to see how they respond to their question. This will reflect whether they respect idea/questions irrespective of who is raising them.
