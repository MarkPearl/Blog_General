#### General Notes about Deadlines ####

##### Real vs Arbitrary Deadlines #####

If an item has a real deadline - a date after which consequences will occur, make it apparent. Often we "pretend" to have deadlines to manipulate people into working harder. These are arbitrary deadlines.

##### Two Types of Deadlines #####

1. **This is important deadline** urgent (mission critical) projects (to prioritize resource allocation and effort)  
2. **This is not important deadline** least important ones (to limit use of resources and effort) 

Prefer to call the "This is not imporant deadline" as a resource limit.   

#### When Deadlines Loose Value ####

- When you cannot guarentee the resources they need to complete the item.  
- When deadlines are arbitrary.  
- When it is not clear if the item is a resource limit.  
- When work items are too large or unclear.  

#### Benefits of Deadlines ####

- Deadlines can effect the amount of scope creep in work requested.  
- Deadlines 'force' people to take action.  
- Timeboxing is valuable for feedback on the chances of an item succeeding.  

#### Disadvantages of Deadlines ####

- Deadlines can effect the quality of the work delivered.  
- Incorrect deadlines can place unnecessary expectations on people to deliver.  

#### Parkinsons Law ####

"Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion"
