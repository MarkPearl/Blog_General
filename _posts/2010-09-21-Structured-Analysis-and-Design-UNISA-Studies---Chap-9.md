Objectives of Chapter 9

Discuss the issues related to managing and coordinating the activities of the SDLC
Explain the major components and levels of design
Describe each major design activity
Develop a simple network diagram
Describe common deployment environments and matching application architectures
Key Words & Definitions
architectural design – broad design of the overall system structure; also called general design or conceptual design
detail design – low level design that includes the design of specific program details
interface designers – specialists in user interface design; also called usability consultants or human factors engineers
computer network – a set of transmission lines, equipment, and communication protocols to permit sharing of information and resources
local area network – a computer network in which the distances are local, such as within the same building
wide area network – a computer network spread across large distances, such as a city, state or nation
router – network equipment that directs information within the network
Internet – a global collection of networks that use the same networking protocol – TCP/IP
World Wide Web - a collection of resources such as files and programs that can be accessed over the internet using standard protocols
intranet – a private network that is accessible to a limited number of users, but which uses the same TCP/IP protocol as the internet
extranet – an intranet that has been extended outside the organization to facilitate the flow of information
virtual organization – a loosely coupled group of people and resources that work together as though they were an organization
virtual private network – a network with security and controlled access for a private group but built on top of a public network such as the internet
network diagram – a model that shows how application layers are distributed across locations and computer systems
single-computer architecture – architecture that employs a single computer system executing all application-related software
multitier architecture – architecture that distributes application-related software or processing load across multiple computer systems
clustered architecture – a group of computers of the same type that share processing load and act as a single large computer system
multicomputer architecture – a group of dissimilar computers that share processing load through specialization of function
centralized architecture – architecture that locates all computing resources in a central location
distributed architecture – architecture that deploys computing resources in multiple locations connected by a computer network
server – a process, module, object, or computer that provides services over a network
client – a process, module, object, or computer that requests services from one or more servers
three-layer architecture – a client/server architecture that divides an application into the view layer, business layer, and data layer
data layer – the part of three layer architecture tat interacts with the database
business logic layer – the part of three-layer architecture that contains the programs that implement the business rules of the application
view layer – the part of three-layer architecture that contains the user interface
web services architecture – a client/server architecture that packages software into server processes that can be accessed via Web protocols
middleware – computer software that implements communication protocols on the network and helps different systems communicate
Example Questions on this Section
What are the key questions that must be decided and implemented with regard to assigning tasks to team members?
The term centralised architecture describes deployment of all computer systems in a single location. Centralised architecture is generally used for large-scale processing applications, including both batch and real-time applications. Give the characteristics of Information Systems in these industries.
