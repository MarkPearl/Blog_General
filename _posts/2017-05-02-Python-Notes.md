Python is interpreted language
~~~
>>> means entering code into interpretor
~~~

#### Numbers

Python has two types of numbers, ints and floats

#### Variables

~~~
variable_name = 60 / 30
~~~

Naming rules: 
* no spaces and you cannot start a name with a special character
* we tend to use underscores to seperate names e.g. your_name

[See PEP 8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)  

#### Importing Modules

~~~
import math
math.ceil(1.23)
~~~

#### Strings

single or double quotes indicate a string

~~~
name = "Your Name"
print(name)
~~~

converting numbers to strings
~~~
name_and_age = "Mark Pearl" + str(35)
~~~
