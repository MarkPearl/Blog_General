title: XAML Developer Reference by Mamta D, Ashish Ghoda; O'Reilly Media

This book is exactly what its title says - a reference book for XAML. It covers all major areas of XAML related programming - focussing mostly on WPF and Silverlight.

My reactions to reading the book – I did find a few gems in the book, but generally it is a reference book and is intended to be read as a reference book (in small sections as needed or as a general overview).

At times I did ask myself what value I was getting from the book vs reading online references like MSDN but if you are the type of person who does not want to be on the internet searching up topics and want a quick reference for XAML - this book will be a useful companion for XAML related programming.
