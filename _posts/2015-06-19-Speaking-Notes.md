#### To consider about A CFP submission

Talk titles (short & sweet): we love a good pun and creative titles, just don't forget to make sure it represents the content of your talk. Keep in mind that the CFP review committee, and eventually the audience, should easily understand what the talk is going to be about.
 
Focus on the takeaways: trying to fit all your content into a brief talk description can be tough - but don't forget that the best descriptions always detail what the audience will be able to apply to their roles.
 
Talk about your passion: speakers' enthusiasm for a topic is infectious and this always helps the audience enjoy the talk even more.
