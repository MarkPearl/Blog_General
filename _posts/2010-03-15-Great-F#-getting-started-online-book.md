So I have been battling around with F# for a few weeks and it has been frustrating just getting my brain around the syntax etc. Then someone put a comment on my blog that I should check out the following online book called the [F# Survival Guide](http://www.ctocorner.com/fsharp/book/).

I highly recommend those wanting to get into the basics of the language to go through this resource. It is easy to understand, especially for someone coming from a C# background.

Give it a readâ€¦ it gets a two thumbs up from me!
