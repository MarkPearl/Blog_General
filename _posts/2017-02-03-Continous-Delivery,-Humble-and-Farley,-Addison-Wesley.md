Continous Delivery book sits firmly in my "Read" section of books. It effectively tackles the theory and concepts behind continous delivery with a balance between technology and underlying principles.I would go as far as to say that in many way's "getting" it is a breakthrough in how we make software.

I read the book cover to cover, it took me a while. I read a section each day on the bus on the way to work. It is condensed reading, this is not a book you can read in one day - there is just too much information in it.

So what stood out?

* Advanced Version Control, comparing distributed version control against centralized VCC was interesting.
* Version Control Everything, including all configuration data really hit home  
* Creating a build pipeline, creating one set of binaries  

# Chapter 9 - Testing Non-Functional Requirements

* How to test non-functional requirements  

# Chapter 15 - Managing Continous Delivery

This chapter covers so of the "managing" aspects of continous delivery. I really liked the maturity model they presented as well as going through the life cycles of creating software.

* Identification  
* Inception  
* Initiation  
* Develop and Release  
* Operation
