I've just had an opportunity to spend a week at [8th Light in Chicago](https://8thlight.com/), the trip was made possible by winning MYOB's IntoTomorrow competition where they give one lucky winner 5 days paid leave and $5000 to do something they wouldn't normally get to do. My submission was for me spending some time with the crafters at 8th Light to find out more about their apprenticeship program. I first heard about 8th Light while attending a talk several years ago at Agile Africa on [Modern Day Apprenticeships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKRghzP9H7M) by Doug Bradbury. 

[Doug](https://twitter.com/dougbradbury), a director at 8th Light and champion of the [Software Craftsmanship Manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) ran the session and spoke about how they were doing apprenticeships. I was intrigued and wanted to learn more and figured a visit to their offices and some time with their people would give me a better insights into if this was a successful way of growing software talent. I've come out for the week really impressed. 8th Light has managed to take people with very limited programming experience and turn them into productive professionals within 6 months - yes, 6 months! They do this through a focussed learning program based around mentorship.

I hope to share some of the learnings in the coming months, but for now I just wanted to thank 8th Light for an amazing week!

8th Light is one of several companies where I have had an opportunity to be a [team tourist](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/Team-Tourism).
