I recently heard about the 7 wastes of lean. Having had a interest in lean processes for software development I was surprised that I had never heard of it before.

On researching it up, it turns out the seven wastes of lean originate from the Toyota Production System. They are:  

#### Original Seven Wastes of Lean

1) Overproduction - to make something before it is actually required  
2) Waiting - whenever a good is not moving or being processed the waste of waiting occurs  
3) Transportation - transporting a product between processes is a cost incursion which adds no value to the product   
4) Inappropriate Processing - using expensive equipment where simpler tools would be sufficient    
5) Unnecessary Inventory - Work in progress is a direct result of overproduction and waiting  
6) Unnecessary Motion - unnecessary bending / stretching / walking / lifting or reaching  
7) Defects - quality defects result in rework  

The worst of all the 7 wastes is overproduction because it includes in essence all others.

### My Seven Wastes of Software Engineering

I like the concept of the 7 wastes of lean, inspired by the original 7 wastes, I came up with my own 7 wastes specific to software engineering.

They are...

1) Over-engineering - to make something more complex than is actually required  
2) Waiting for dependencies - having to wait for an external dependency on work you have already started 
3) Hand offs - whenever an individual or group has to hand work over to another group or individual  
4) Inappropriate Technologies - using expensive technologies where a simpler technology would be sufficient  
5) Unnecessary work in progress - working on more things simultaneously
6) Unnecessary refactoring - refactoring code that does not need to be touched  
7) Defects - fixing errors that could have been avoided initially
