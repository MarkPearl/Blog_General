I understand that this will require some effort to give feedback however I believe it is important. I would like you to keep the following in mind:  
 
* Make your feedback straightforward and honest  
* Be kind, not nice  
* Highlight areas of improvement  
* Don’t write a book   
* Don’t worry that what you say will cause bad things to happen to your coworker   
* Use the experience as a chance to think about your own contributions and behaviors  
   
From my side, when reviewing the feedback I’m looking for patterns of feedback I will keep the feedback anonymous unless there is something meaningful to talk about. If there is I will engage with you first to get full context. If you have any questions please ask them on this thread.
