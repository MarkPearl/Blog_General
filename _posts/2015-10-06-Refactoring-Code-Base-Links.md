> It’s easy to look at work that came before you and decide it’s no good and that you can do better. This is the wrong attitude. It will lead you down a very dangerous path.  

#### 7 Key takeaways for refactoring legacy code

1. Never judge legacy code or change it until you’ve taken the time to fully understand it.  
2. Sequence diagrams are your friend.  
3. Prefer small, incremental improvements over wholesale re-writes or changes.  
4. Each change should attempt to leave the code a little better off than it was when you found it.  
5. If you need to make big changes, make a business case and get approval first.  
6. When adding new features, try to “go with the flow.”  
7. If you need to take the code in a new direction, isolate your changes and use the Adapter Pattern to integrate.
