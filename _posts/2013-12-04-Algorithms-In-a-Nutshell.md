Good reference book.

I recently did an introductory 'Artificial Intelligence' course at University and this book proved to be worth the spend. It covers a range of algorithms - from sorting algorithms all the way to path finding and everything in between. 

It was way better than the books prescribed for the course by that particular University. I liked its hands on approach - the explanations for each algorithm are concise with practical examples.

This is a good reference book, one worth owning - especially if you are a student and are battling with the standard academic textbooks that attempt to cover the same topics.
