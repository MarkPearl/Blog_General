With MIX2011 starting today I thought it was quite ironic that I have spent the last few days watching MIX2010 (I guess that means I am at least a year behind the world Winking smile).

One of the presentations that I really enjoyed had very little to do with programming, but I found extremely entertaining and almost immediately useful. It was title “The Art, Technology, and Science of Reading” and was presented by Kevin Larson who works in Microsoft’s Advanced Reading and Technology team.

So, if you have the time, give it a watch, if not, I have listed a few of the slides/points he brought up for quick reference below…

There are cognitive benefits for good page layout.
