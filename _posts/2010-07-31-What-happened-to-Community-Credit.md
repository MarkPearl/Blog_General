title: What happened to Community Credit

I noticed recently that I have stopped receiving community credit emails whenever I post a new blog. I just wanted to know with any other geekwithblogs bloggers if there is some setting that has changed in the last month or so to cause this?

Anyone else experienced this, or am I special?
