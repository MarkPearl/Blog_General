No matter what one writes, no matter how carefully one tries to articulate it, a non-trivial segment of the readership will interpret it differently from what one intended - J.B. Rainsberger

#### Semicolons

There's a lovely and beautifully self-demonstrating description of how punctuation marks work stylistically in Lewis Thomas's little piece on Punctuation.

I have grown fond of semicolons in recent years. The semicolon tells you that there is still some question about the preceding full sentence; something needs to be added; it reminds you sometimes of the Greek usage. It is almost always a greater pleasure to come across a semicolon than a period. The period tells you that that is that; if you didn't get all the meaning you wanted or expected, anyway you got all the writer intended to parcel out and now you have to move along. But with a semicolon there you get a pleasant little feeling of expectancy; there is more to come; to read on; it will get clearer.

#### Avoid Protracted Introductions

Undue emphasis on relatively unimportant matters before getting to the heart of the problem is not a great way of writing.

Use First, instead of "First or all"  
Use First, instead of "The first point I want to make is"  
Use Next, instead of "What I want to do next is"  
etc.

#### Use it, there, and what considerations carefull  

An expletive is a place holding word such as it, there, and what that fills a vacancy in a sentence without adding to its meaning. A common type of wordiness results from beginning sentences with it is, when *it* is used as an expletive.
