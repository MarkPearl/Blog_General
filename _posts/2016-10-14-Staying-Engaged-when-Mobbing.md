title: Staying Engaged when Mobbing

A recent challenge my team is facing as they begin to adopt mob programming as their default way of doing work is staying engaged during discovery phases. An example of where this became apparent was when we were working on automating a section of our build pipeline - we all see the value of automation AND currently we have vastly different levels of comfort automating things.

I've noticed that up to now, when I'm not in the mob, rotating the driver has been relaxed - sometimes they will do it at a regular cadence, sometimes they will not. I happened to be away from the team for a few days at a point when the team started some automation work. The person with the most knowledge about automation ended up behind the keyboard. They started moving really quickly. 

Because we had such a wide gap in understanding what was happening, people began to get disengaged as they understood less and less of what the driver was doing - they were still 'at the mob' but were not 'in the mob'. With time they began to exercise the law of two feet.

Lucklily this didn't happen for to long before it was brought up, on discussion we decided that the person with the most context should be at the keyboard the least - a techique adapted from strong pairing.
