title: Staying Engaged when Mobbing

A recent challenge my team is facing as they begin to adopt mob programming as their default way of doing work is staying engaged during discovery phases. An example of where this became apparent was when we were working on automating a section of our build pipeline - we all see the value of automation AND currently we have vastly different levels of comfort and knowledge on the tool and infrastructure for automating things.

I happened to be away from the team for a few days at a point when the team started some automation work. I've noticed that up to now, when I'm not in the mob, rotating the driver has been relaxed - sometimes the mob will do it at a regular cadence, sometimes they will not. In this instance, the person with the most knowledge about automation ended up behind the keyboard. They started moving really quickly. While they had a much better understanding of the tools we were using for automation, they also didn't understand the tools properly and were clearly in the discovery stage while attempting the work.

Because we had such a wide gap in understanding what was happening, people began to get disengaged as they understood less and less of what the driver was doing and as he went down certain 'dead ends'- people were still 'at the mob' but were not 'in the mob'. With time they began to exercise the law of two feet and go back to their own desks.

Lucklily this didn't happen for to long before it was brought up, on discussion ensued on what we should do in situations like this.

We decided on a few things:
- The person with the most context should be at the keyboard the least - a techique adapted from strong pairing  
- If it feels like the entire mob is not going anywhere, and we need to do some basic tutorials on something and it is best done on ones own, time box that period and then resume the mob.  

### Strong Pairing

The person with the most context not driving is not a new concept - I've been familiar with it from pair programming days where it is called strong pairing. This type of approach can be a challenge for developers who have not fully developed the skill of navigating and it is a useful challenge to conquer.

In this instance, as we began to implement strong pairing we noticed the following behavior. The person with the most context up to that point who had also been driving the most began to be frustrated - we were moving slower than we were before and he was battling to verbalize what he wanted the driver to do. It was also clear that the people who had been at the mob up to then but not really in the mob had some big gaps in their understanding of what had happened over the last few days. 

It tooks us several hours, some deep breaths and lots of joking around before we began to have some breakthroughs. Understanding began to spread across the whole mob - gaps were filled and the team is in a better place than it was before.
