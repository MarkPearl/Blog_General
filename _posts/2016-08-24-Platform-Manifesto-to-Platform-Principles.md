title: From Platform Manifesto to Platform Principles

We are in the process of moving from a product centered development approach to a platform centered development approach. This not only changes how we make things, it also means we need to change our mindset.

To help us along this transition, as an organization we have adopted a 'platform manifesto' - it's something we have on pretty much every wall in our development space - it's in our face all the time. It goes as follows:  

### The Platform Manifesto

~~~
- Medium term thinking over short term thinking  
- Existing experiences over different variations  
- Capabilities as services over monolith extensions  
- Existing assets over new development  
- Nurture the platform over feature delivery  
- Automation over manual repetition  
- Asynchronous interactions over synchronous coupling  
- Stable technologies over the unproven  
- The greater good over individual objectives
~~~

#### Whats we have learnt from the manifesto

The great thing about a manifesto is that it is a public declaration about our how we do things as engineers. Several times in design discussions a colleague has challenged a particular approach, quoting a section of the manifesto. 

#### The problems 

Having a platform manifesto was a step forward in the right direction. It helped highlight what mindsets and approaches we needed to change.

### Our Goal

- Provide reusable functionality to other consuming products and services (Be unique, independent & resilient of others)  
- Accessible via a consistent manner by our products, services & clients 
- Built to be secure, to scale and to be easily operated by ourselves  
- Built for today's use, however designed for future evolutionary needs  
- Be proliferated though our products and services via reuse, rarely rebuilt or duplicated
- Supported by base core platform services and third-party supplier products  



### Principles 

- Always build functionality as independent re-usable services, accessible via an API
- Always re-use or consume services via their API's  
- Always design services to support asynchronous interactions  
- Everything that is repeated is automated  
- Everything must be build secure  
- Everything must be tested  
- Everything is built to be centrally monitored and audited  
- Everything is logged to a central service
