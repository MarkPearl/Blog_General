When mobbing, your physical environment matters. Having an environment that is condusive for mob programming plays a major role in whether the practice becomes entrenched in a team.

> Humans are lazy, you want minimal effort required to assemble a mob

#### The core components

I find the following components are key to having a comfortable mob programming experience.  

1. Large Screen TV (at least 50")  
2. Separate smaller screen for mob timer (19" - 21")
3. Whiteboard that is accessible for writing and brainstorming  
4. Comfortable area where people can sit or stand side by side without feeling cramped  
5. Adjustable sitting / standing table with usb hub and multiple keyboards  
6. Wireless mouse  

#### If you can, rent or borrow equipment first

If you don't have the equipment for an ideal environment try renting before you buy. Getting the right sized TV, projector or desk first time round is unlikely. Every group has different needs.

Having the equipment lying around and not being used after you got management to go on a limb for you to buy the stuff isn't the best way to get buy in.

#### What about the costs?

Having an ideal mobbing environment is going to cost some money, however relative to what software developers get paid, the cost is tiny. Once you have proven a practice is useful to a team, having the discussion on costs is a lot easier.

#### What if you have no money?

It's great having an ideal setup, however don't let that stop you. The first mobbing station I setup cost the business nothing. I brought my 40" TV from home to the office for two weeks. We found a space to set it up and try things out. I had a brief disucssion with my manager before I brought the equipment in just to get his buy in. Other than that we pretty much flew under the radar. There was no fanfare or big announcmenet with mobbing - we just did it.

Once we had proven that this was a practice our team would use, we then had the discussion with management on getting the right equipment to make it effective. Having a buy in from the rest of the team helped make this an easy discussion.

#### Up the signal, reduce the noise

Ultimately with you mob enviroment you want to up the signal and down the noise. Mob stations are noisier than traditional work areas. Because people are interacting there should be talking, laughter, etc. in the mob.

Being in a work environment where there is a lot of background noise can be tough for a mob to communicate effectively. Unfortunately you don't have the convenience that solo developers have of putting on headphones. 

Find an enviroment that is condusive to upping the signal and reducing the noise. This can be ideally achieved  when a mob has their own room or work cove, however this is not th eonly way to achieve this. I've had work environments where we had movable whiteboards which doubled up as great sound barriers. If the room was getting to noisy, we would use the whiteboards as noise blockers.
