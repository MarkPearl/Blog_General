When mobbing, your physical environment matters. Having a space that is conducive for mob programming plays a major role in the practice becoming entrenched in a team.

> Humans are lazy, you want minimal effort required to assemble a mob.

### How much space do you need?

How much space do you need to do mob programming? When getting started I've seen teams get away with little if no additional work space. This is easiest done by booking a meeting room to try the experiment. Having a insulated room away from inquisitive outsiders gives the team a safe place to try the experiment. 

Starting with a meeting room works great initially, with time the overhead of getting people to the room and getting set up can become a barrier. Also, expect to have situations where you can not book the same meeting room - soon the effort of moving meeting rooms and the overhead in getting a comfortable setup quickly becomes obstructive.

If you plan on taking an approach like this be mindful of the distance the meeting room is away from the teams normal work area. The further the distance, the more effort required for people to get there. My advice is if you can use your existing work area for mob programming, this usually raises the chances of mob programming becoming a habit.

Once you have moved from mob programming being something you want to try to it being a practice you want to adopt permanently, adjusting the team work area to be the primary mob programming place and making it conducive to this is essential.

Usually a little more space than your traditional desk / cubicle layout office allows. If you look at how much space you would need for a meeting room to comfortably seat your intended mob size, you will need about the same physical space for mob programming to happen.

#### Things you will need

I have found the following things are key to having a comfortable mob programming experience.  

1. Large Screen TV (at least 50")  
2. Separate smaller screen for mob timer (19" - 21")
3. Whiteboard that is accessible for writing and brainstorming  
4. Comfortable area where people can sit or stand side-by-side without feeling cramped  
5. Adjustable sitting / standing table with multi port USB hub 
6. Wireless mouse  
7. Mini pc used for remoting in to the developer machine
8. Assortment of keyboards the team prefers

#### Mob station layout

The layout of the mobbing station is very reliant on the space you have available. I like mobbing stations that can handle 4 - 6 people comfortably (this is my ideal mob size). 

The table is usually 2 to 3 meters away from the large screen, with the smaller "timer" screen off to the side where it is clearly visible to the mob. The whiteboard, facing the mob, is within reach so that notes can be made frequently on the board.

The typist typically positions themself center of the large screen.

#### Rent or borrow equipment first

If you don't have the equipment for an ideal mob environment up front, try renting or borrowing the equipment first before you buy. Getting the right sized TV, projector or desk first time round is unlikely. Every group has different needs.

Having the equipment lying around and not being used after you got management to go on a limb for you to buy the stuff isn't the best way to get buy in.

#### What about the costs?

Having an ideal mobbing environment is going to cost some money, however relative to what software developers get paid, the cost is tiny. Once you have proven a practice is useful to a team, having the discussion on costs is a lot easier.

#### What if you have no money?

It's great having an ideal setup, however don't let that stop you. The first mobbing station I setup cost the business nothing. I brought my 40" TV from home to the office for two weeks. We found a space to set it up and try things out. I had a brief disucssion with my manager before I brought the equipment in just to get his buy in. Other than that we pretty much flew under the radar. There was no fanfare or big announcmenet with mobbing - we just did it.

Once we had proven that this was a practice our team would use, we then had the discussion with management on getting the right equipment to make it effective. Having a buy in from the rest of the team helped make this an easy discussion.

#### Up the signal, reduce the noise

Ultimately with you mob enviroment you want to up the signal and down the noise. Mob stations are noisier than traditional work areas. Because people are interacting there should be talking, laughter, etc. in the mob.

Being in a work environment where there is a lot of background noise can be tough for a mob to communicate effectively. Unfortunately you don't have the convenience that solo developers have of putting on headphones. 

Find an enviroment that is condusive to upping the signal and reducing the noise. This can be ideally achieved  when a mob has their own room or work cove, however this is not th eonly way to achieve this. I've had work environments where we had movable whiteboards which doubled up as great sound barriers. If the room was getting to noisy, we would use the whiteboards as noise blockers.
