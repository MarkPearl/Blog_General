When mobbing, your physical environment matters. Having a space that is conducive for mob programming plays a major role in the practice becoming entrenched in a team.

> Humans are lazy, you want minimal effort required to assemble a mob.

### Starting out...

When starting out what sort of physical environment does a team need? I've seen teams get away with little, if any additional work space and no new hardware. This is easiest achieved by booking a meeting room.  

Having a insulated room away from inquisitive outsiders gives the team a safe place to try the experiment of mob programming. In addition, meeting rooms are normally already equipped with a projector or large screen - a component I consider essential for mob programming to happen. 

When choosing a room keep in mind the distance it is from the teams normal work area - the further away, the more effort required for the mob to assemble (remember, people are lazy).

### It's hard being a nomad mob  

Starting with a meeting room works great initially, with time expect to have situations where you can not book the same meeting room day in and day out. If you are not careful your mob will soon become a nomad mob wandering from room to room with no real home - you want to avoid this! The overhead of moving people regularly and getting set up quickly kills momentum and disrupts flow resulting in a poor experience or the mob disassembling.  

Instead, as soon as the team has reached the point where they want to move mob programming from an experiment to a more permanent practice, you want to be having discussions with the powers that be on adjusting the teams normal work area to make it conducive for mob programming - I call this stage settling down a mob.

### Settling down...

When settling down there are a few things you should consider regarding the physical environment. You want to make sure you have enough space in your team area dedicated to mob programming. Typically, this means having more space than you would need with a traditional desk / cubicle layout. A good rule of thumb is to look at how much space you would need to comfortably seat your average mob in a meeting room - you will need roughly the same amount of space in your work area for the mob station.

#### Mob station layout

In addition to physical space, it helps to have a mob station set up that is ready to use at any time. I have found the following have helped in having a comfortable mob programming station to work at.  

1. Large Screen TV (at least 50")  
2. Separate smaller screen for mob timer (19" - 21")
3. Whiteboard that is accessible for writing and brainstorming  
4. Comfortable area where people can sit or stand side-by-side without feeling cramped  
5. Adjustable sitting / standing table with multi port USB hub 
6. Wireless mouse  
7. Mini pc used for remoting in to the developer machine
8. Assortment of keyboards (wireless if possible, but whatever they are comfortable with)   

#### Rent or borrow equipment first

If you don't have the equipment for an ideal mob environment up front, try renting or borrowing the equipment first before you buy. Getting the right sized TV, projector or desk first time round is unlikely. Every group has different needs.

Having the equipment lying around and not being used after you got management to go on a limb for you to buy the stuff isn't the best way to get buy in.

#### A typical layout

The exact layout of the mobbing station is very reliant the size of the mob you want to cater for. My ideal mob size is 4 to 5 people so I like mobbing stations that can handle this number of people comfortably.

Assuming your mob is about the same size, the table will usually be 2 to 3 meters away from the large screen, with the smaller "timer" screen off to the side where it is clearly visible to the mob. The whiteboard, facing the mob, is within reach so that notes can be made frequently on the board.

The typist typically positions themself center of the large screen.

#### What about the costs?

Having an ideal mobbing environment is going to cost some money, however relative to what software developers get paid, the cost is tiny. Once you have proven a practice is useful to a team, having the discussion on costs is a lot easier.

#### What if you have no money?

It's great having an ideal setup, however don't let that stop you. The first mobbing station I setup cost the business nothing. I brought my 40" TV from home to the office for two weeks. We found a space to set it up and try things out. I had a brief discussion with my manager before I brought the equipment in just to get his buy in. Other than that we pretty much flew under the radar. There was no fanfare or big announcement with mobbing - we just did it.

Once we had proven that this was a practice our team would use, we then had the discussion with management on getting the right equipment to make it effective. Having a buy in from the rest of the team helped make this an easy discussion.

#### Up the signal, reduce the noise

Ultimately with you mob enviroment you want to up the signal and down the noise. Mob stations are noisier than traditional work areas. Because people are interacting there should be talking, laughter, etc. in the mob.

Being in a work environment where there is a lot of background noise can be tough for a mob to communicate effectively. Unfortunately you don't have the convenience that solo developers have of putting on headphones. 

Find an enviroment that is condusive to upping the signal and reducing the noise. This can be ideally achieved  when a mob has their own room or work cove, however this is not th eonly way to achieve this. I've had work environments where we had movable whiteboards which doubled up as great sound barriers. If the room was getting to noisy, we would use the whiteboards as noise blockers.
