#### Imperative Coding ####

Imperative coding is the traditional code we usually write. It expresses actions as a series of lines of code indicating logical flow and assignment. Imperative code consists of complex algorithms and logical statements that direct and exact sequence of operations.

#### Declarative Coding ####

Declarative coding specifies what's to be done, not how to do it. Declarative code is simple - It's just a statement, not an instruction set.
