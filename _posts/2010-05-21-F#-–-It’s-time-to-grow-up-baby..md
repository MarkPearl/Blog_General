In the last few months since I started learning F# I have begin to notice an increase in the number of people blogging about the language. Sure, it could just be that I am noticing it more because I am actively looking out for questions and blog posts, but even in my day to day reading of Code Project Daily News and Stack Overflow questions there seems to be increased activity around the language.

So what sparked this post? Well, today today I logged in and saw that the latest podcast by DNR was on F# and then immediately afterwards I received an email from CodeProject with a great article comparing F# and Scala.

Currently, as of this blog posting (21 May 2010) F# is ranked on the tiobe site at position 43, but I am willing to put money on it that in the next few tiobe ratings this ranking will continue to rise till F# will be a top 20.
