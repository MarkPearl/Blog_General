You don't empower people to please them, you empower them to make better decisions than you.

We played the game, some notes on what we could do better:

* We saw value in the game  
* We needed to be more specific on the decisions being determined, we were too generic, we felt that it would be better to take real world secenarios  
* We had some confusion around what each card meant. It would help to have the decisions better explained.
