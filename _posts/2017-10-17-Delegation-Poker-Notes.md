You don't empower people to please them, you empower them to make better decisions than you.

We played the game, some notes on what we could do better:

* We saw value in the game  
* We needed to be more specific on the decisions being determined, we were too generic, we felt that it would be better to take real world secenarios  
* We had some confusion around what each card meant. It would help to have the decisions better explained.

* Sometimes the situations were out of the control of all people in there, there was no way to easily indicate this using the cards.  
* Start off with specific scenario's, the general principles come from the conversation around the specific question.
* It takes a long time to have the conversations, expet to cover one or two scenarios at most in a 1 hour session
