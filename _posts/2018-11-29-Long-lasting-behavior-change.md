# Summary 

Lasting change takes time. Often we try and convince ourselves that change is not possible by cognitive distortions including:

* Mental filtering - finding a single negative consequence from the change and fixating on that  
* Overgeneralization - I didn't manage to change last time so I won't be able to do it in the future  
* Discounting the positive - minimizing the benefits of change  

Connecting to your core values is one of the most powerful ways to strengthen your intrinsic motivations. You should identify your core values!

When going through change, protect your mindset, create a routine that supports the change. Keep momentum, you may have slippages but don't let that overcome your resolve.
It is often useful to have a coach or someone that can help keep you accountable.
