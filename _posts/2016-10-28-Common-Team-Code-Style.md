When you start mob programming you will immediately notice there is a discrepency in coding standards amongst your team. 

Before, having a consistent team coding standard was hard. If you were in teams similar to the ones I was in, you probably had a team document outlining stylistic code prefences, a peer review process when someone completed a feature, or even practiced pair programming. While all these practices are good, I have found them to not be as good as mob programming at achieving a consistent team code standard. 

It comes down to two things that mob programming does that other practices do not do at the same level:

1. Near zero latency between the code being written and people reviewing it  
2. High diversity in the feedback with multiple people giving their input

### The challenge of near instant feedback

The challenge of near instant feedback from a group of people who have never coded together before is conflict. This conflict most often manifests itself in stylistic code preferences (turns out most programmers are passionate about the code they write and how they write it). If the conflict is not managed effectively it escalates. As it escalates you risk people getting jaded and not wanting to participate in the mob again. Having an explicit strategy for handling conflict in a mob is very important.

#### See initial conflict in a mob as a good thing

First, it helps for a team to recognize that initial conflict in a mob is a good thing. It shows you the people in your team care about the code and that there was a discrepency. 

Secondly, if your team tackles the conflict properly they will end up with a consistent team code standard. Being able to open up a code base and not being able to differentiate between the code you wrote and the code someone else wrote in your team because the code is consistent leads to greater productivity and more developer happiness.everything
