Project Managers, To Do Lists Fans, this is something you got to look at!

So I saw one of my clients using this really useful tool called ToDoList done by AbstractSpoon. I have been using it just for a day now and already I am impressed by how easy it is to configure.

It allows you to have a hierarchal order of tasks, assigns costs per item, assign specific people to tasks, etc. All this in a simple but really easy to use interface. Whatâ€™s even better is that it is free!
