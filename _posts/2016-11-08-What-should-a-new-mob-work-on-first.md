Once you have your physical layout sorted and your mob development environment agreed on, the only thing you need to think about before you can start your first session is what to work on?

The most important rule when coming up with what to mob on is "Find something the mob is interested in". It doens't make sense doing a Kata as a mob, if the people in the mob are not interested in kata's. 

For many mobs it is fine to just pick something off your backlog. Everyone has a vested interest in "getting work done", it is safe to tackle that.

## Start with work that everyone can contribute too

I would recommend avoidind work that only one person in the mob has deep expertise in.
