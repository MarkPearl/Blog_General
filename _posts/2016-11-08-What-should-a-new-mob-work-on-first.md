What does a new mob work on? Do you do Kata's, actual work items or something else?

There is no right answer in this case, only things to look out for in the thing you pick.

- It should be interesting  
- It should be small
- Everyone should be able to contribute

## It should be interesting

Find something the mob is interested in. If the mob is interested in kata's, do kata's. If you pick actual work items, pick items that are of interest. 

Avoid work that is repetetive, unchallenging and requires no thought - this work is boring in it's very nature and does not demonstrate the benefits of mob programming.

## Everyone should be able to contribute

Look for something that everyone can contribute to. Work that is particularly deep that only one individual has experience with is more challenging to mob on than work everyone can contribute to. This is because it requires stronger collaboration skills to mod on.

## It should be small




## What if you can't find appropriate work?

If you are in the situation where you cannot find appropriate work you have a decision to make. If you feel it is unlikely that you will have work like this for the foreseeable furture I would recommend just picking something off your backlog as a mob.

If in the near future you will have work like this, it may be worth postponing your first mob programming session until you get to that work.

## Should all work be like this?

Does this mean that all work the mob does in future needs to have these attributes? Absolutely not! These are just things you want to look out for when a mob is starting. Once a team buys in to the benefits of mob programming they will sometimes do some 'boring' work.
