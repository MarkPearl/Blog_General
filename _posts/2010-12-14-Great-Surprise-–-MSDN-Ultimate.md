So, I attended the Microsoft Community Evening. The attendance was better than I was expecting for December and we had our first Programming Languages Meeting where Gary did a great presentation on an intro to Ruby.

The best surprize of the evening happened when I was about to leave, Robert MacLean asked me how we did our MS licensing – the fact being that we were about to reach the end of our empower license with Microsoft and that I had no idea how we were going to afford upgrading it early next year. Well, out comes a Microsoft Visual Studio Ultimate with MSDN 12 month subscription. An absolute awesome gift – thanks Robert! Best gift ever!
