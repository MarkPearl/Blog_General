title: Why do a Hackathon?

In the last two years I have attended 2 hackathons from two different companies. Both have been great experiences that I have been grateful to attend. 

While I have walked away from these events with what I personally wanted to achieve, I've also come away with one big question...  

> Why is the company doing this? What are they wanting to get out of this?

The answer of course depends on the company, it could be any of the following...  

- We are trying to increase developer moral?  
- We are trying to encourage collaboration between people that do not normally work together?  
- We are trying to get people to look at technologies they would not normally play with?  
- We are trying to support solving problems that support the business that do not have a clear commercial value?  
- We are trying to foster better ideation processes?   
- We are doing this because other companies do this but for no other reason?

### What I have learnt so far... 

Below are a few insights that I have gained from my experiences of hackathons...  

### Beware of tuckman stages of group development

If you don't know [tuckmans stages of group development](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/Tuckmans-Model) - it's worth a read. In essence whenever forming a team or a group, you see forming, storming, norming, performing stages.  

If in your hackathons you are going to form groups of people that do not normally work together, you are going to see these stages manifest themselves during the hackathon. If the objective of the hackathon is to produce something, you may want to adjust how you form your teams. Let me explain.  

Because hackathons are generally time boxed events of a day or two you don't have enough time to get to the performing stage if you are in a newly formed team. This means is if you are aiming to 'produce' something, by forming new teams that have not worked together before you are hindering the ability for the team to make something useful.

> I would suggest keep teams small, ideally people in the teams should have worked together before the day in some way.  

On the counter to this, if your objective is to get people to form relationships with people they have never or infrequently worked with before quickly, giving them a 'hard' or 'impossible' time frame to work under is a great way to accelerate people bonding. Nothing better than being in an impossible task with other people to accelerate progression through tuckmans four stages.  

### Be mindful of the technology stack  

You are on a really tight timeline. You have got 12, 24 or 48 hours to produce something. Do you really think you can code something in that time frame while learning a totally new technology stack at the same time?

My experience is you are going to be able to do one of the two, but not both.

From a learning perspective, I learn the fundamentals best on my own. This gives me time to google, do tutorials, and let the knowledge seep in. Once I have passed the fundamentals, my learning is accelerated by learning in groups.

If I'm at a hackathon and **everyone** in the group is learning a totally new technology stack it's a smell. I want at least one person there to have a good understanding of the tech stack before we start. What I've found is if nobody has a good understanding of the tech stack there is quite a strong social pressure to learn together as a team. Learning something totally new as a team has not worked well for me.

> Make sure you have the fundamentals covered before the hackathon, or stay with a tech stack that most people are comfortable with.  

### Separate ideation days from hackathons

Getting everyone on the same page for a great idea is hard. Coming up with a great idea is extremely hard. You face all the challenges during the ideation stage that you face during the make it stage.

In the hackathons that I have been to, I've seen ideation been done badly. It's either been tackled as part of the hackathon, or it has been handled in a set of brainstorming sessions before the hackathon. Neither has felt ideal.  

#### Ideation as part of the hackathon

You take a bunch of people, all with different skills and expertise, give them a fixed short period of time in a newly formed team and then say **GO**.  

Well, guess what happens, the coders want to code, the analysts want to analyze and the testers (if they are traditional testers) don't know what to do.

Having ideation as part of the hackathon has not been a good idea. There is a lot of storming. My observation is you end up with low impact ideas.

> Avoid ideation as part of the hackathon  

#### Ideation as a set of brainstorming sessions  

So, you have decided to separate the hackathon from the ideation. Great idea. You set up a series of one hour meetings for a month or so before the hackathon for 'ideation'. Chaos ensues...  

Ideation is hard. Having one hour sessions to come up with a really good idea doesn't feel like the best way to tackle things. It's like trying to cook a really good meal but you can only add a new ingredient to the mix once a week. 

Ideation as a set of context switched brainstorming activities does not flow enough for my liking. I want a block of continuous time to come up with a really good idea.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

### My ideal hackathon

After thinking about my past experiences I've come up with my own ideal hackathon. I'm sure it has flaws, but here is how it stands right now...  

My ideal purpose of a hackathon is to **support solving problems for the business that do not have a clear commercial value or that have a lot of uncertainty?**  

Personally I think collaboration across teams and developer happiness can be handled in other forums. And I have never worked for companies that suffer from FOMO so I'm not motivated by that.  

#### Ideation as a separate flow based activity

I think ideation should be given more airtime and potentially done by a smaller group than the people who make the thing. 

**Who should be involved?**  

Firstly, ideation does not have to have all the people involved that you will have involved at the actual hackathon. Ideation is just for the people that want to come up with a new idea. Some people like doing this, other people just want to make things and don't care what. If you like ideation be there, if you just want to make something it's best you wait till the actual hackathon.

**So how long should ideation take?**

I propose ideation over a one and a half day period. That means one and a half days to come up with a really good idea.

One and a half days you say - that seems like a really long time just for the idea?

Yes it is, let me explain why I motivate this length. 

Day one you form your ideation group. That means you have to go through tuckmans stages, present different ideas, fight, disagree, fork, branch and reform groups etc. That's going to take you a while.

The aim is by the end of day one you should have put together some sort of idea on what the thing is going to look like. 
Have some sort of high level pitch on what you are going to solve, how it will kind of work and why. No coding!

The second day is important, because ideas need to settle. Going home and sleeping on it and them coming back the next day once the idea has settled but still taking your attention is going to give you some critical insights you did not have the day before. It also gives you a bit of time to tweak your idea and your pitch.
 
#### Pitching your idea to the hackers  

Once ideation is finished you pitch your idea. Who do you pitch to? The hackers.

The goal of the pitch is to show a really good idea and get an idea of who would like to be involved in making it. Once you have pitched, we move on to selection.

**Selecting hackers for an idea**

Selection on who is actually going to make the thing is done slightly differently. Each hacker selects three ideas they would like to spend their hackathon on. They interview at their top project - those already in the ideation team get to choose if they want that hacker in the team or not. If they get picked, they then are involved in selecting the remainder of the team. If not they move to their second selected project and repeat the process. If they don't get selected for anything, they can choose to do their own thing on the day or just do normal work.

#### Making the proof of concept - the actual hackathon

The actual hackathon should be a little down the road. Good hackers need time to think about tech stack, learn fundamentals, etc. I would do a hackathon a month or so after ideation and team selection is completed. This gives time for people to tinker, play around with ideas etc.

On the day or days, it's about making the thing. You have only x hours to finish your POC.

#### Feedback and where to next

To close the loop, when the hackathon ends there needs to be some feedback. 

I've seen feedback best done in a bazaar style where people walk from table to table to see demonstrations.

> A bazaar style session with token voting system  

Everyone is given tokens. Different people are given different amounts of tokens based on their role in an organization. Normal people are given two or three token, top execs given ten or fifteen, or some sort of ratio - the tokens need to look identical so that you don't know who gave you a token after the fact.

People go from team to team to get a demonstration of their project. If someone thinks their project is a good idea they give some of their tokens to that team.

For me it's important that the payment of tokens is done concealed so that the team doesn't know who is giving them the tokens or who has given them the tokens. I've seen a token based voting system before, but it was done in front of the team, which kicked in all sorts of social pressures on when tokens were given - you got to work with these people tomorrow in your day job, sometimes you just want to keep them happy. 

For me the ideal should be that  you can lie if you want and say, hey nice idea - I'm going to give yo a token, and then not actually have to give them one if you don't really want to.

I would recommend not lying, but you want to door open for people who do lie to be able to.

The question people should be answering when paying tokens is, 

> Would you like to see this project given more airtime to further explored
