In the last two years I have attended 2 hackathons from two different companies. Both have been great experiences. Having been two events marketed under the same title 'Hackathon', I've gained a bunch of insights and also questions about events like these.

All my questions can be grouped under one big question...   

> Why is the company doing this? What are they wanting to get out of this?
