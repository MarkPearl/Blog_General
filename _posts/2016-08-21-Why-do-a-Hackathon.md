title: Why do a Hackathon?

In the last two years I have attended 2 hackathons from two different companies. Both have been great experiences that I have been grateful to attend. 

While I have walked away from these events with what I personall wanted to achieve, I've also come away with a question on why we are there in the first place. The question is...   

> Why is the company doing this? What are they wanting to get out of this?

The answer of course depends on the company, looking at it from a very high generalized level it could be any of the following:  

- We are trying to increase developer moral.  
- We are trying to encourage collaboration across people that do not normally work together.  
- We are trying to get people to look at technologies they would not normally play with.  
- We are trying to support disruptive innovation.  
- We are trying to support solving problems that support the business that do not have a clear commercial value.  
- We are trying to foster better ideation processes.   
- We are doing this because other companies do this but for no other reason.  

### Insights from my experiences  

Below are a few insights that I have gained from my experiences of hackathons...  

#### Beware of Tuckman Stages of Group Development

If you don't know [tuckmans stages of group development](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/Tuckmans-Model) - it's worth a read. In essence whenever forming a team or a group, you see forming, storming, norming, performing stages.  

If in your hackathons you are going to form groups of people that do not normally work together, you are going to see these stages manifest themselves during the hackathon.

Because hackathons are generally time boxed events in my experience you don't have enough time to get to the performing stage. What this means is if you are aiming to 'produce' something, by forming new teams you are hindering the ability for the team to make something useful.

I would suggest keep teams small, ideally people in the teams should have worked together before the day.

On the counter to this, if your objective is to get people to form relationships with people they have never or infrequently worked with before quickly, giving them a 'hard' or 'impossible' time frame to work under is a great way to accelerate people bonding. Nothing better than being in an impossible task with other people to accelerate progression through tuckmans four stages.
