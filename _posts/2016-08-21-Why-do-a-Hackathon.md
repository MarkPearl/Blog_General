title: Why do a Hackathon?

In the last two years I have attended 2 hackathons from two different companies. Both have been great experiences that I have been grateful to attend. 

While I have walked away from these events with what I personally wanted to achieve, I've also come away with one big question...  

> Why is the company doing this? What are they wanting to get out of this?

The answer of course depends on the company, it could be any of the following...  

- We are trying to increase developer moral.  
- We are trying to encourage collaboration between people that do not normally work together.  
- We are trying to get people to look at technologies they would not normally play with.  
- We are trying to support solving problems that support the business that do not have a clear commercial value.  
- We are trying to foster better ideation processes.   
- We are doing this because other companies do this but for no other reason.  

### What I have learn't so far... 

Below are a few insights that I have gained from my experiences of hackathons...  

#### Beware of Tuckman Stages of Group Development

If you don't know [tuckmans stages of group development](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/Tuckmans-Model) - it's worth a read. In essence whenever forming a team or a group, you see forming, storming, norming, performing stages.  

If in your hackathons you are going to form groups of people that do not normally work together, you are going to see these stages manifest themselves during the hackathon. If the objective of the hackathon is to produce something, you may want to adjust how you form your teams. Let me explain.  

Because hackathons are generally time boxed events of a day or two you don't have enough time to get to the performing stage if you are in a newly formed team. This means is if you are aiming to 'produce' something, by forming new teams that have not worked together before you are hindering the ability for the team to make something useful.

> I would suggest keep teams small, ideally people in the teams should have worked together before the day.

On the counter to this, if your objective is to get people to form relationships with people they have never or infrequently worked with before quickly, giving them a 'hard' or 'impossible' time frame to work under is a great way to accelerate people bonding. Nothing better than being in an impossible task with other people to accelerate progression through tuckmans four stages.  

#### Be mindulf of the technology stack  

You are on a really tight timeline. You have got 12, 24 or 48 hours to produce something. Do you really think you can code something in that time frame while learning a totally new technology stack at the same time?

My experience is you are going to be able to do one of the two, but not both.

From a learning perspective, I learn the fundamentals best on my own. This gives me time to google, do tutorials, and let the knowlege seep in. Once I have passed the fundamentals, my learning is accelerated by learning in groups.

If I'm at a hackathon and am learning a totally new technology stack, I actually want to do it on my own however there is this pressure to do it as a team. Learning something totally new as a team has not worked well for me.
