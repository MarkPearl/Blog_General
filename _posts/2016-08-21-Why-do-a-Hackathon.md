title: Why do a Hackathon?

In the last two years I have attended 2 hackathons from two different companies. Both have been great experiences. 

Having been two events marketed under the same title 'Hackathon', I've gained a bunch of insights and also questions about events like these. All my questions can be grouped under one big question...  

> Why is the company doing this? What are they wanting to get out of this?

The answer depends on the company, it could be any of the following:  

- We are trying to encourage collaboration across people that do not normally work together.  
- We are trying to support disruptive innovation, ideas that would not get the day of light in our normal prioritizations.  
- We are trying to increase developer moral.  
- We are trying to get people to look at technologies they would not normally play with.
