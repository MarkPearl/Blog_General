title: Why do a Hackathon?

In the last two years I have attended 2 hackathons from two different companies. Both have been great experiences that I have been grateful for. While personally I have walked away from these events with what I wanted to achieve, I've noticed a common question that often isn't clear to those attending...  

> Why is the company doing this? What are they wanting to get out of this?

The answer of course depends on the company, looking at it from a very high generalized level it could be any of the following:  

- We are trying to encourage collaboration across people that do not normally work together.  
- We are trying to support disruptive innovation, ideas that would not get the day of light in our normal prioritizations.  
- We are trying to support solving problems that support the business that do not have a clear commercial value.  
- We are trying to increase developer moral.  
- We are trying to get people to look at technologies they would not normally play with.  
- We are trying to foster better ideation processes.   

### Insights from my experiences  

Below are a few insights that I have gained from my experiences...  

#### Beware of Tuckman

If you don't know [tuckmans stages of group development](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/Tuckmans-Model) - it's worth a read. In essence whenever forming a team or a group, you see forming, storming, norming, performing stages.  

If you are trying to encourage collaboration across people that do not normally work together, you are going to see these stages manifest themselves. Because hackathons are generally time boxed events in my experience you don't have enough time to get to the performing stage. My means if you are aiming to 'produce' something, rather keep teams that are small and do it with people that you have worked with before.

On the counter to this, if your objective is to get people to form relationships with people they have never or infrequently worked with before quickly, giving them a 'hard' or 'impossible' time frame to work under is a great way to accelerate people bonding. Nothing better than being in an impossible task with other people to accelerate progression through tuckmans four stages.
