I first read about the concept of different stages of naming on J. B. Rainsberger's [blog](http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-four-elements-of-simple-design) in 2015. At the time I had already recognized a pattern when I was selecting names for methods and variables, although I hadn't been able to formalize it yet.

The original four stages of naming go as follows:

As Joe explains, laziness or ignorance push us towards the left end of this spectrum, while with diligence we can move to the right. He goes on to say that names further to the right of this spectrum provide more clarity.

Early 2016 I was shown a take on naming stages that makes things even more granular and can reveal some further insights. It's titled the six stages of naming.
