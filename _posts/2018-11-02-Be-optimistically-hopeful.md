A while back I read somewhere how it was really important to select your mentors carefully because mentee's tend to mimic their mentors.

Good mentor == good mentee.

Over the last year I've found this nugget of advice manifest itself in many mentor/mentee relationships.

Today I want to expand on this, I'm finding when mentors are optimistic and hopeful their mentee's are the same, when they are experiencing despair and depressed their mentees pick up on this and emulate it.

My advice is if you are actively mentoring someone be mindful of your state of mind. Don't let your own negative experiences bubble down to your mentee.
