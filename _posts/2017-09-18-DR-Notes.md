* Identify & name critical people charged with responding to a crisis
* Identify which systems are covered
* Identify third party vendors and how to contact their support services
* Identify priorities, what's most important - not everything in your business is worth saving  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Steps to putting a DR Plan together

### Step 1 - Identify critical services 

* Compile list of cricital business services  
* Determine the services and applications used by these critical services  

For each service list the following:
* Service Name  
* Where it is located  
* What days / times it is critical for the service to be operational  
* Are there any manual work arounds  
* What is the maximum allowable outage time  
* What are the supporting services  

### Step 2 - Assess impact of service outage

* Determine impact of service outages on organization  
* Identify maximum allowable down time, and data loss  

For each service, list the following:
* Service Name  
* Rate impact (Major, Moderate, Minor) if service is not available in each category: Safety Human Life / Financial / Reputation / Regulatory  

### Step 3 - Assess Risks

* Assess the threats & vulnerabilities that could cause disruptions to the services and processes  
* List known risks  
* Identify risks  

### Step 4 - Prioritize Services  

* Categorize and prioritize services based on need and criticality (use the risk matrix high, medium, low)
* Rate each service on a tier system, tier 0 is core infrastructure services, lower numbered tiers are recovered first as they are more critical to higher numbered tiers

### Step 5 - Set Scope  

* Determine which services to develop recovery plans for first  
* Focus on Medium or High Risk area, usually you will not cover low risk or non-critical system functions  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Areas each service recovery plan should cover

* Guidelines for determining plan activation;  
* Guidelines for recovery procedures;  
* References to key technical dependencies;  
* Rollback procedures that will be implemented to return to standard operating state;  
* Checklists outlining considerations for escalation, incident management, and plan activation

# Assess Risks


# Have regular practice drills

DR plans should be tested reguarly, find a cadence that works that keeps the team in sync

# Keeping it up to date

Update DR Plan after changes are made to an internal system
