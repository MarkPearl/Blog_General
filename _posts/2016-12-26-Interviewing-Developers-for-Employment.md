## Before the face to face interviews

* Initial phone screen
* Coding exercise
* Cv history 

## Face to face interviews 

* Initial 1-hour interview, of high level cultural and technical questions (perhaps some whiteboarding). In this interview you would be honing in on their motivations too.
* When hiring developers we don’t usually state in interview a specific team, as it may change and we want developers who are open to working across different teams. Usually in interview we will form a decision of which team would suit that candidates’ motivators best and we will try best match that / as well as work out where our biggest need is at that time.

## 6 people in interview with the following time frames (give or take)

*  45 min cultural chat with the Development Lead / Development Manager 
*  45 min technical discussion with a Development Lead and Senior Developer
*  45 Pairing session with an experienced member of the team
 
## Two way street 

* Candidates experience of the interview process is important, regardless if the candidate is right or not for the company. If it is not working out in an interview, you should still be thoughtful of the candidates opinion. The candidate should have a positive experience regardless of whether they are a good match or not.

## It’s a 2-way conversation

It is just as important to learn about the candidate as it is for them to learn about you and our business. They could walk away without the job but still recommend us to their friend who might be good for us, due to having a great experience.

* An intro on on the company and what the business is about
* An intro on your team and what you are looking to achieve in the next 6 – 12 months
* An intro on each of yourselves as an individual and what you do and what your passions are
* A walk of the floor, showcasing the development environment and team areas
* The candidates background and career journey

*  Motivators
*  Passions
*  Why us?
*  Technical expertise
