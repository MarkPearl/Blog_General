* Smile Often.  
* Laugh with your team.  
* Model Vulnerability. If we you are asking your team to talk about times they have felt in the dark, nervous, concerned, etc., you need to be willing to do the same.  
* Circulate, spend time with different people in your team  
* Remain Calm at All Times. Once you lose it with a team member it takes a long time to rebuild that feeling of safety and trust within the team. Step right outside the door and take a few breaths. It's worth it.
* Admit When You Don't Know. Your team appreciates when we show our humanity. Saying "I'm not really sure. Does anyone else know?" is powerful stuff.
