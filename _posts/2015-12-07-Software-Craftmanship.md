#### General ####

Working is a minimum requirement.  

Started about 25 years ago. 
Jack Reeves prposed that creating software was more design than engineering
Pragmatic programmer subtitle was "from Journeyman to Master Craftsman"

"We feel that there is no point in developing software unless you care about what you do"

Definition of Craft - "**skill** in making things by hand". 
Definition of Pride - "A genuine **deep satisfaction** derived from one's own achievements"

It is all about nurturing the skill

Developers shoud direct their learning.
Craftmanship is about getting better at Software Development
Great software deserves to be signed

Uncle Bob suggested that the agile manifesto should be ammended and "Craftmanship over crap" be added. This was then ammended to "Craftmanship over execution"
