I've recently been thinking around retention in the software development world. Why do some companies have such great retention while others such poor retention. It's a complex topic but today I wanted to write about a little framework I came across called the ACM Framework.

I was introduced to the ACM Framework while reading [@alan's manager readme](https://github.com/angryweasel/managerreadme) on GitHub. ACM stands for "Ambitious, Comfortable, Mundane framework" and is a way for categorizing the typical work a technical person does.

As Alan explains, the idea is if you look at the work a software developer does you will find some of the work is ambitious (or new & challening), some of it are things you are already really good at b(comfortable work), and some of it is boring and mundane (it just needs to get done).

Alan goes on to explain that each week he wants his technical people to have some ambitious work that is grows them. He also wants to minimize their mundane work (often the mundane work may be someone else's ambitious work).

# My thoughts on ACM work

I think this framework is a great way to spark conversation around helping people stay engaged in what they are doing. Yes, there will always be some mundane work that need to be done however too much mundane work leads to people getting bored and being unmotivated which in return results into poor quality and high turnover of staff.

Actively identifying the categories of work leads to people being engaged and motivated.

# Optimising ACM work

An exercise with this model is to simply list the work you do in a sprint (or in a 1-2 week period), and then classify it into the three categories. The list should have a balance of enough Ambitious work that you're not overwhelmed, and little or no Mundane work - with Comfortable work to fill the gap. 

If the balance is off, we should discuss, as there's likely a way to find balance by shifting work around, discovering new work, or stopping work on some items entirely.
