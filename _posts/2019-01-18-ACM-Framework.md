The ACM Framework was something I came across while reading [@alan's manager readme](https://github.com/angryweasel/managerreadme). It stands for "Ambitious, Comfortable, Mundane framework".

As Alan explains, the idea is that if you look at the work a software developer does you will find that some of the work is ambitious (or new & challening), some of it is things you are already really good at (comfortable work), and some of the work is boring or mundane... it just needs to get done.

Alan goes on to explain that each week he wants you to have some ambitious work that is grows you and that he wants to minimize your mundane work (often the mundane work may be someone else's ambitious work).

# Optimising ACM work

An exercise with this model is to simply list the work you do in a sprint (or in a 1-2 week period), and then classify it into the three categories. The list should have a balance of enough Ambitious work that you're not overwhelmed, and little or no Mundane work - with Comfortable work to fill the gap. 

If the balance is off, we should discuss, as there's likely a way to find balance by shifting work around, discovering new work, or stopping work on some items entirely.
