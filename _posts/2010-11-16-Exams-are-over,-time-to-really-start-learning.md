So my UNISA exams are over for the year – and I can finally dedicate some time to professional learning. Since my last development blog post I have had the opportunity to be exposed to some great technologies that I would like to learn more about, so here’s the plan…

Continue my exploration of F# and finish reading Expert F#
Learn Blend, partly because I feel it is a great tool that exposes some of the real power of XAML
Do a few blog posts on my .Net Based RF Reader
Explore some more design principles and put C# examples of all the major design patterns
So that’s what you can expect in the next few months
