## Principles for Team Metrics

- Assume that the people we are looking at the metrics are not prics - metrics do not give you context or allow you to do comparisons between teams. It does however give you indicators on whether a team may need help, etc.  
- Prefer leading metrics to lagging metrics - metrics that show things before the fact are more useful than metrics that show things after the fact.   
- Keep things simple - metrics that are simple to collect and understand are preferred to metrics that are complex to collect and/or understand.   
- Keep things convenient - metrics that offer slightly less value but require no major team process adjustments are preferred to metrics that require major team process adjustments.   

## Proposed metrics for the team

### How are metrics collected

- Because we value human interactions we currently prefer physical team boards to digital team boards. This means that collecting metrics will require more effort than for teams who use digital boards.
- Most metrics will be taken from artifacts that the team uses (board, cards, etc) HOWEVER, we understand that people make software and so understanding how the people that make our software are feeling is also extremely important.

### Questions asked per team member each week on a Friday 

- As a team this last week we made measurable progress towards our strategic work as well as improving our system

	I strongly agree / I'm not sure / We definitely didn't


- This last week I strived to do my best work

	I'm Distracted / I'm tried, but not sure if I was successful / Yes, I did

Progress is what ultimately motivates us all and makes us happy—working on a team where we feel we're making progress, working alongside people we trust and connect with, creating something really important.

- Do you feel as a team we are meeting external expectations on <list external expectations>... 


### Metrics gathered each week 

- Cycle time on Red, Yellow, Orange & Green Cards

	- Red card (POBT Items or bug that have been reported to us of things that are already in production that need to be fixed)
	- Orange card (Misc or Ops cards - work that does not meet our event line strategy or adhoc ops tasks / investigations)
	- Yellow card (Work that helps us meet our strategy eventlines - typically this relates to a user story on JIRA)
	- Green card (Strategic technical improvement cards - technical improvements we feel necessary to help us get legacy systems to meet platform principles)

	What is Cycle Time for us? For us cycle time is the measure of the elapsed time from the moment we "start' working on an item until it is released into production. For us start is when we have pulled a card from our backlog into 'Dev' column. 
	Why is it important to us? Cycle time reveals how smoothly work is flowing through our development process. It helps us spot bottlenecks and see the effects they have on your delivery.

- How long does it currently take us to get a single line of code from 'ready for release' to 'released' - measured in hours

	- We are looking to focus on this area going forward and at some point measuring actual time to release, for now we are just going an a rough estimate.

 

Quantitative data on how the team is improving
Progress tracking on delivery to give us a feel for when we will be done and how we can project future work
Impact of wasteful activities
 
I acknowledge that some teams are still learning how to track progress themselves and decided to include a brain dump of different types of metrics that I can think of (without debating the merit of each);

Performance
Delivery rate on estimate hours, story points or story counts (velocity)
Performance of actual delivery vs estimated delivery over time.
Delivery speed such as lead times, cycle times
Utilisation, capacity, etc.
Number of releases per day or week
Flow and Waste
“Value add" time vs "Non-value add time”
Wait time and Hand-offs
Task switching and interruptions
Day stories been blocked or not moving
Ad-hoc non-backlog work, meetings, etc.
Rate of unplanned work added to backlogs
Work in flight and queues
Defect rates / Change request rate
Support calls / incidents
General
Team / customer / product management happiness
NPS
Test coverage
Build success rate
Value
Impact on revenue by features
Cost of delay
NPS
Improvement
The effect of improvements on the above
Number of experiments per month
#### Some metrics that may be useful  

Event Line -> Milestones
Estimates -> Predicatbility  

Peformance?
- Why do they need the data?  
 
Visibility?

ROI vs Performance  

Should
Event Lines? 
-  Goals

### Establishing Pulse of team

- Social Connection
- Brand & Company Reputation  
- Rewards & benefits  
- Career opportunities  
- Values  
- Service & Quality  
- Feedback & recognition

#### Enablement

- I have access to the things i need to do my job well  
-  The process for managing performance here enables me ot perform at my best  

#### Feedback & recognition  

- I receive appropriate recognition when I do good work, beyond my pay  

#### Leadership  

- The leaders have communicated a vision that motivates me  
- The leaders demonstrate that people are important to the company's success  
- I have confidence in the leaders  

#### Learning & Development 

- I have access ot the learning & development i need to do my job well  

#### Management  

- My manager gives me useful feedback on how well I am performing  

#### Values 

- I know what our company values are...

#### Service & Quality  

- I believe we learn from client feedback and make improvements accordingly
