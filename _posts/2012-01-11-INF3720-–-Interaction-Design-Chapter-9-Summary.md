Aims of this Chapter
Consider what doing interaction design involves
Explain some advantages of involving users in development
Explain the main principles of a user-centred approach
Ask and provide answers for some important questions about the interaction design process
Introduce the idea of a lifecycle model to represent a set of activities and how they are related
Describe some lifecycle models from software engineering and HCI and discuss how they relate to the process of ID
Present a lifecycle model of interaction design
Summary
What is involved in interaction design
Design involves working on requirements, designing a solution, producing the solution and evaluating it.

Design is about trade offs – cost vs. effectiveness etc. and so key to design is generating alternatives.

Involving users and others in design process means that the designs and potential solutions need to be communicated to people other than the original designer. There are many ways of doing this.

The importance of involving users

The best way to make sure that development continues to take users activities into account is to involve real users throughout the development. In this way developers can better understand user goals leading to a more appropriate more usable product. It also assists in setting expectations of the user.

Expectation management is the process of making sure that the users view and expectations of the new product are realistic.

It is better to exceed user expectations than to fall below them.

There are several ways to set user expectations including

Involving them throughout the design and developing stages
Have timely training
Degrees of user involvement

User involvement depends on what is involved and the nature of the product, on one end of the scale you can have the user involved all the time on the other end of the scale you could keep them informed via newsletters

How actively users should be involved is a matter of debate, too much user involvement can lead to issues and not enough user involvement can lead to poor solutions.

What is a user centred approach

Three principles that lead to a user centred approach

Early focus on users and tasks – see goals below
Empirical measurement – be able to measure what you are wanting to achieve
Iterative design – perform design in small steps
With an early focus on users and tasks it can be further broken down into categories

User tasks and goals are the driving force behind the development
User’s behaviour and context of use are studied and the system is designed to support them
User characteristics are captured and designed for
Users are consulted throughout development from earliest phases to the latest and their input is seriously taken into account
All design decisions are taken within the context of the users, their work, and their environment
Four Basic activities of Interaction Design

Identifying needs and establishing requirements for the user experience
Developing alternative designs that meet those requirements
Building interactive versions of the designs
Evaluating what is being built throughout the process and the user experience it offers
Some practical issues that need to be considered
Who are users?
What do we mean by needs?
How do you generate alternative designs?
How do you choose among alternatives?
Lifecycle models: showing how the activities are related
Some software engineering lifecycle models

The waterfall lifecycle model
The spiral lifecycle model
Rapid applications Development
Agile development
Lifecycle models in HCI

The star lifecycle model
The usability engineering lifecycle
Human centred design process for interactive systems
Star Lifecycle Model

 

Star Lifecyucle Model

 

Does not specify any ordering of activities
Activities are highly interconnected
Evaluation is central to this model – whenever an activity is complete it must be evaluated
Usability Engineering Lifecycle

Essentially has 3 tasks

Requirements Analysis
Design / Testing / Development
Installation
ISO 13407 Human-centred design processes for interactive systems

International standard for providing guidance on human centred design activities.

Standard identifies four principles of human centred design

Active involvement of users and clear understanding of user and task requirements
An appropriate allocation of function between users and technology
The iteration of design solutions
Multi-disciplinary design
It specifies four human-centred design activities as being central to a system development project:

To understand and specify the context of use
To specify the user and organizational requirements
To produce design solutions
To evaluate designs against requirements
