I would like to...

* Help set the strategic vision of an organization, being involved in the wholistic aspets of an org (sales / marketing / development / support) although being focussed at the software engineering aspect
* Be involved in the "growing people" side of things and creating a space that people can thrive
* Be involved in creating something... want to have skin in the game (i.e. compete, not advise)   
* Be involved determining who joins an organization (hiring & firing)   
* Be involved in determining the environment that people work in  
* Be involved in setting the values / principles of an organization  
* Be involved in setting the culture of an organization (culture of learning, improving, working hard, working smart)  
* Be involved in determining where money is spent / invested  
* Be involved in leadership & vision setting  
* Be involved in conveying the vision to others  
* Travel occaisonally, 1-2 times a month for 1-2 days  
* Work with people who are candid and direct and can give me clear and immediate feedback  
* Work with people where it is more than a 9 to 5 job, where they truly care about the outcome  
* While money is not the main driver for me I have a problem with being on a fixed salary, have an environment where I'm rewarded for results, can pay the bills, take my family on nice holidays and get financially independent  
* While I don't have an issue with administration, I would prefer to "outsource" administration to others and oversea  
* Have a job where I can put my best 8 hours
* Family is important and so having my evenings / time to spend with my family is important - 
* Feel connected to a group where people are working together to create something  


Things to do for next time...  
* Figure out cost of delays
* Figure out the business model behind the systems
