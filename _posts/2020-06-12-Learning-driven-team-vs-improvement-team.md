I'm passionate about learning. It's something that part of my day to day activities. Many years ago I watched a talk (I can't remember which one) that spoke about the need for software organisations to be learning organisations. The permise was that as knowledge workers, actively increasing knowledge was essential to staying ahead of the curve. It resonated with me. Since then, I've always strived to create teams and a culture that actively learn and grow. 

One example was a team I lead I'll call my "learning team". As the leader I wanted to create a learning environment. To do this I promised the team one day a week focussed on improvement and learning. A combination of team led and individual led learning activities. I gave freedom to each individual to pick what they wanted to learn. 

Over time I noticed that people focused on things they were passionate or interested in. Some used the time to learn new programming languages, others spent time learning new technologies, others processes or methodologies and so on. As the leader, I felt mission accomplished. I'vehad created a learning culture. 

Looking back I got it wrong. The ultimate purpose of my role should have been to increase the sustainable output of the team. While creating a learning enviornment could lead to increased output, it also may not. It depended on two factors. What people were learning, and if they were able to apply that learning. 

What you learn is important. Each person should have started with focussing on what was foundational for their current role and contributions to the team. This was not the case in my lerning team.

In my learning team I had people who had still not mastered their core skills learning things on the fringe of their role. For example, I had one person learning random C# libraries when they could still not produce basic clean testable C# code. Very little value from the investment. Poor leadership. Having individuals focus on what they were learning is important.

The second aspect is the ability to apply the learning to increase performance. Being driven to learn or accomulate knowledge that does not lead to increased performance is misallocated time. I've worked with people who are extremely knowledgable but when given an opportunity to produce things they are unable to do it effectively. That knowledge is waste. The learning should not be valued.

So the lesson. As a leader I've moved the focus. I no longer focus on "learning". Instead the focus is on improvement. Improvement neans producing tangible improved results.
