This was some advice a NFL coach would give to his team. I think many of these draw parallels to software development.

1. Be a pro  
2. Act like a champion  
3. Respond to adversity; don't react  
4. Be on time, being late means either it's not important to you or you can't be relied upon.  
5. Execute, do what you are supposed to do when you're supposed to do it. Not almost, All the way. Not most of the time. All of the time.  
6. Take ownership
