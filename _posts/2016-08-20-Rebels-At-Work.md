#### Risk vs Uncertainty (Chapter 3)

Risk means you have some knowledge of what could go wrong. There are known factors to research & assess.  
Uncertainty means what might happen is unknowable; you haven't done this before and don't know how it might turn out.

Gain credibility by separating risk from uncertainty.  

- Be open about risks connected with your idea and describe how you plan to research & manage them.  
- Be forthright about what is uncertain and unknowable and what can be put in place to quickly respond and adapt.  

#### Building Trust (Chapter 3)  

Building trust comes down to:

- Doing what you say you're going to do  
- Being genuinely committed to helping  
- Helping others without expecting anything in return  
- Admitting mistakes and providing early warnings when you see that things are unlikely to go as planned  
- Not gossiping or saying hurtful things  
- Being respectful of others (getting to meetings on time, meeting deadlines, answering time sensitive email promptly)  

#### Don't forget about the people

> Organizations are made up of people. 
> All change affects people. 
> You may have a strategy that could double sales, cut costs by a third, and win industry admiration. 
> Nonetheless, it still affects people. 
> To be successful, figure out how people feel and what anxieties or fears your idea might provoke, and then factor that into how you frame, socialize, and implement your idea.
> Organizations don’t change; people do. “Leadership” doesn’t say yay or nay to an idea; people do.
