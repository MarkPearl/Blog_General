### Chapter 3 - Gaining Credibility

#### Risk vs Uncertainty 

Risk means you have some knowledge of what could go wrong. There are known factors to research & assess.  
Uncertainty means what might happen is unknowable; you haven't done this before and don't know how it might turn out.

Gain credibility by separating risk from uncertainty.  

- Be open about risks connected with your idea and describe how you plan to research & manage them.  
- Be forthright about what is uncertain and unknowable and what can be put in place to quickly respond and adapt.  

#### Building Trust 

Building trust comes down to:

- Doing what you say you're going to do  
- Being genuinely committed to helping  
- Helping others without expecting anything in return  
- Admitting mistakes and providing early warnings when you see that things are unlikely to go as planned  
- Not gossiping or saying hurtful things  
- Being respectful of others (getting to meetings on time, meeting deadlines, answering time sensitive email promptly)  

### Chapter 4 - Navigating the Organizational Landscape

#### Five core skills in negotiating  

The five core skills in negotiating according to Robert Fisher and Samuel Williston of the Harvard Negotiation Project:  

1. Empathy  
2. Making people feel personally connected to you  
3. Showing how the idea preserves or expands the other person’s autonomy  
4. Acknowledging the other person’s status  
5. Making people feel that they have a say and are playing a meaningful role in the negotiations

#### Don't forget about the people

The more you know how things—and people—tend to work, the better the relationships you can develop.  

> Organizations are made up of people. 
> All change affects people. 
> You may have a strategy that could double sales, cut costs by a third, and win industry admiration. 
> Nonetheless, it still affects people. 
> To be successful, figure out how people feel and what anxieties or fears your idea might provoke, and then factor that into how you frame, socialize, and implement your idea.
> Organizations don’t change; people do. “Leadership” doesn’t say yay or nay to an idea; people do.
