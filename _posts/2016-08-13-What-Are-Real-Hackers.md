#### The Hacker Way ####

> The Hacker Way is an approach to building that involves continuous improvement and iteration.   
> Hackers believe that something can always be better, and that nothing is ever complete.   
> They just have to go fix it—often in the face of people who say it’s impossible or are content with the status quo.
