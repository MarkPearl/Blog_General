title: Understanding the 4 rules of simple design by Corey Haines
tags: Read

This little book is jam packed with code design insights! I've been a fan of Code Retreats for many years, Corey Haines, the original founder of Code Retreats took many of the learning he gained from doing Conways Game of Life and packed it into this little book under the title "The four rules of simple design".

One of the best insights I've gained is around Naive Duplication where he talks about the difference between code duplication and domain duplication.

There are other gems in this book. I really recommend you read it!
