This book didn't appeal to me as much as I thought it would. It is written much in the same light as pragmatic programmer, but somehow does not have the punch that pragmatic programmer had. There were some interesting topics, code generators as a way of speeding up development is an interesting approach, although one I am not totally sold on yet. But generally I found this a light book with very little meaning for me.
