Before you start your first mob programming session, it helps to get consensus on the development environment the mob is going to use. Programmers often have very different development environments, geared towards their preferred way of working.

## Keyboard Shortcut Mappings

### Identify what preferences individuals in your mob have for keyboard shortcuts

Start off by identifying the various shortcut mappings individuals in your mob currently us. Don't assume that because everyone in the mob uses the same editor, you will all have the same keyboard shortcuts! Some editors provide multiple keyboard shortcut flavours. 

For instance, I have spent a large part of my professional career using Visual Studio with Resharper as a plugin. Resharper gives at least two options for key mappings - the classic Visual Studio key mappings as well as IntelliJ key mappings. 

### See if you can quick switch mappings

Find out if in your current editor it is possible to quickly switch between the various keyboard mappings that everyone in the group uses (by quickly I mean anything under 2 seconds, anything over that is going to frustrate you). Some editors allow quick switching, in which case you will probably not feel any pain with keyboard shortcuts.

### If you can't quick switch, what do you do?

If your editor does not allow for quick switching - or switching takes too long - you are going to need decide on a mob standard. Picking the keyboard mapping that is easiest for the entire mob to adopt upfront is going to reduce the pain you feel.

### A word on vi and vim

I'm a vim fan. I've been using it for years. It has significantly changed the speed at which I can write and morph code. If you are a vi or vim fan, but some people in your mob are not, I would recommend for initial mob sessions to not try and teach them how to use this editor while mob programming. 

Being put in front of a group of developers and not being able to even type a single letter can be frustrating, embarassing and alienating. Rather pick a editor that everyone can be productive in from day one. With time, as your mob settles and gets comfortable with each other, you can look at showing them the light of vim. For the sake of the mob, you will have to go slower initially.

For emacs users, best you learn a proper editor like vim :-)

## Turn on absolute line numbers

When mob programming have absolute line numbers tuned on. Aboslute line numbers speed up
