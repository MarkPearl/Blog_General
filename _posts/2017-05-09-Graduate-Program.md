Graduates have several touch points:

*The goal of the graduate program is not to get the most immediate value out of the work out of the graduate or to get "cheap" labour. The goal is to invest in growing someone to become a great employee.*

We believe to achieve this we need:

* Structure  
* Supervision  
* Long term outlook  

# It begins with a mentor

## What type of mentorship are we referring to?

We are referring to the type of mentorship where an experienced software developer takes an inexperienced software developer (graduate) under their wing in order to teach them the skills necessary to become a professional software developer. In effect, the mentor is akin to the tour guide that takes a person through a foreign city showing them the best of what the city has to offer and bypassing the uninteresting and unsafe parts.

## Identifying mentors in your organization

* Who would you like to clone?
* Who is always willing to help other people out?
* Who has their own good skills and disciplines?

Mentors should be people you want more of, they should be the best of the best.

# Identifying Graduate Candidates

Good graduates should show the following attributes:

* Smart, we want people with natural intelligence  
* A doer, can the person get things done  
* A self-motivated learner, there is no spoon-feeding in learning  
* Humble, there should be no ego   
* Committed, they should push through the resistance of tough problems  
* A hacker, they should already tried to write some software, software should be their thing  
* Live our values, they should be aligned to MYOB 6 core values  

## How does a graduate get a mentor and a team?

Because mentors are heavily invested in their graduates and will be investing several hours a week with them (we believe this could range from anywhere between 3 to 5 hours a week) the mentor should be involved in choosing a graduate to work with and should make the final choice on their mentee.  

Once a mentor has selected a graduate, the graduate joins the mentors team.

## What interactions does a mentor have with a graduate

* At least one 1-on-1 a week
* pair programming with the graduate on learning material
* discussions around reading & blog posts

## What does a graduate work on

*The graduate learns by doing*

The work that graduates does should focus on what the graduate needs to learn
Graduates should **not** be treated like 2nd class citizens and given the 'dirty' jobs to do, they should pair/mob on high value items with their mentor and the rest of their mentors team
Graduates will also have work to do for the Jedi academny, they should take time each day to work on their Jedi academy work during off peak team times

# The Jedi Academy

The Jedi Academy is a supporting structure to provide increase graduates knowledge in being a professional software developer. Jedi academy will meet every two weeks to focus on a a fundamental area of development.
Each session is facilitated by different expert in the organization. Sessions can be up to 4 hours, with pre and post session work.

Some of the fortnigtly topics include Crafting Code, TDD, Refactoring, Design principles, Object Oriented Design Patterns, etc

For a more complete breakdown of topics covered view the [following post](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/Jedi-Academy)

# From Graduate to Employee

Assemble a team of 8 or so people for a review board. Graduate is given a mixture of experiences/projects to complete within a short time frame. These should necessitate new learning, demonstrate acquired skills. There will be a review day when a presentation and "defense of challenges" is done. The review board makes a decision

Yes - renew contract
No - part ways / extend graduate
