If you want to check some c# code on the fly without using VS  

So I was listening to Hanselminutes podcast show number 200 with Jon Skeet, and Job was speaking about how he answers most of his Stackoverflow questions in notepad.  

Scott said that he did something similar to Jon but that he used a program called SnippetCompiler that worked much like notepad, but with a compile button added to it so that he didn’t have to use the command line stuff.  

I tried it and it is really cool… so if you are looking for something to just test a block of code, maybe give it a try.
