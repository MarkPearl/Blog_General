In a parallel world there is a job where people get paid to solve puzzles - now, when I say puzzles I mean the real puzzles with puzzle pieces you have to put together to make a picture. 

In this world there are all sorts of puzzles; some puzzles are small, some are big, some are complex while others are really simple ordinary puzzles. 

You are young and have just finished school and love solving puzzles as a hobby. The thought of getting paid to solve puzzles blows your mind - it would be like getting paid to have fun! 

Lucky for you there is a company down the road that pays people to solve puzzles, you apply to them for a position and actually get the job!

Your first few weeks as a professional puzzle solver are amazing, you get your first puzzle, it's a lot more complicated than the puzzles you did at home, but you put your best effort in and eventually manage to finish it. You feel really fulfilled.

You then get your second puzzle. It's pretty similar to the first one, you manage to finish it slightly faster than it took you to do the first - you have a sense of achievement that you are doing great work. 

You then get the third puzzle, it's pretty much the same as the previous two puzzles - this time you manage to do in a couple of days but it is not really feeling like a challenge - your boss tells you that you you are getting a reputation for being really good at solving these types of puzzles. 

You get the fourth puzzle, it's identical to the first! You do the puzzle, but to keep it challenging you only use your left hand to place the pieces.

And so as the months go on you keep getting the same type of puzzles over an over again. 

Yes the pictures are not identical, and the pieces in each puzzle are slightly different, but essentially it's the same puzzle.
