I once watched a talk where the speaker explained how each person has their own reality. We tend to think of ourselves like a camera with one dialogue but really everyone is seeing different things with different realities.

Take the animation below, what shapes do you see from the dots? It depends on how you connect the dots, you may see three squares, a star or four triangles

In life it's pretty much the same, we interpret what we see based on how we connect the dots (our context and interpretation of the facts).
