There are different waves of trust

## Self Trust

Self trust == credibility

## Relationship Trust

> What you do has far greater impact than anything you say.

Trust accounts
* A relationshp has two trust accounts, one for each direction of the relationship
* What one person thinks is a deposit is not necessarily seen the same way by the other
* Withdrawls are usually larger than deposits (when you do something wrong, the impact is often far bigger than doing something right)

When you extend trust, if you give it to everyone you can be vulnerable, if you give it to noone you are unproductive. Use SMART Trust to be strategic on how to extend trust.
