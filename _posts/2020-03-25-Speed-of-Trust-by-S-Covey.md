There is a tax on productivity/how fast you can move when trust is low

Trust has 4 cores
1) Integrity
2) Intent
3) Capability
4) Results

There are different waves of trust
1) Self Trust
2) Relationship Trust
3) Organizational Trust
4) Market Trust
5) Societal Trust

There are 13 behaviours that support the 4 cores
1) Talk Straight
2) Demonstrate Respect
3) Create Transparency
4) Right Wrongs
5) Show Loyalty
6) Deliver Results
7) Get Better
8) Confront Reality
9) Clarify Expectations
10) Practice Accountability
11) Listen First
12) Keep Commitments
13) Extend Trust

When you extend trust, if you give it to everyone you can be vulnerable, if you give it to noone you are unproductive. Use SMART Trust to.
