Chapter 13 - Company level vision and strategic intents

Often in a single product company the company vision and product vision are the same.

Difference between company vision and company mission?

Mission explains why the company exists
Vision explains where the company is going

Combining the mission and the vision into one statement gives you the value proposition of the company.

Try not to be too broad in your vision and mission statements, they should give some focus. i.e. being the best in everything everywhere is too broad.

Visions should last the life of the company, however there may be different ways of accomplishing a vision.

Strategic intents communicate the current area of focus that the company is using to achieve its vision.
