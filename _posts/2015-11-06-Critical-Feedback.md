## Different types of feedback

There are four different types of feedback, only 2 of them build relationships of trust and respect in the process.  

1. Praise  
2. Critcism  
3. Constructive feedback (positive)  
4. Constructive feedback (negative)  

### Negative Types of feedback

#### Praise

- This is a personal judgement, a favourable judgement  
- It's general and vague  
- Doesn't encourage discussion so it can come across as hollow, insincere or lacking substance  
- Focused on the person  
- Based on opinions & feelings  

Damaging as you can come across as hollow, or saying good things for the sake of making the other person feel good.

#### Criticism

- This is a personal judgement, an unfavourable judgement  
- General and vague  
- Without specifics it can lead to a battle over whose perception is 'right' or 'wrong'  
- Focussed on the person  
- Based on opinions & feelings  
- Often laced with 'I'm just being honest'

### Positive Types of feedback

#### Constructive feedback (positive)  

- Information specific, issue focused, and based on observation  
- About an effort well done
- Objective, specific and non-judgmental  
- It is not 'right' or 'wrong' so it encourages discussion
- The other person knows what to do to replicate the behavior

#### Constructive feedback (negative)

- Information specific, issue focussed, and based on observation  
- News about an effort that needs improvement  
- Not accusing - focussed on outcomes  
- Objective, specific and non-judgemental
