Responsible: People or stakeholders who do the work. They must complete the task or objective or make the decision. Several people can be jointly Responsible.

Accountable: 
* Person who is the "owner" of the work
* Only ONE person Accountable, which means that "the buck stops there."

Consulted: 
* People or stakeholders who need to give input BEFORE the work is started done
* These people are "in the loop" and active participants.

Informed: 
* People or stakeholders who need to be kept "in the picture." 
* Often they are only informed AFTER the decision or action is made
