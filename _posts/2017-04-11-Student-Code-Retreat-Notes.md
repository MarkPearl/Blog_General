A typical Code Retreat is a day long intensive practice event focussed at core practices that professional software developers use to create software. Typically this covers things like:

* Pair Programming  
* Test Driven Design  
* Refactoring  
* 4 Rules of Simple Design
* Core Design Principles around a Programming Paradigm (OO, Functional, etc.)  

A Student Code Retreat is based on the normal Code Retreat, but is simplified further to make it easier for students.
