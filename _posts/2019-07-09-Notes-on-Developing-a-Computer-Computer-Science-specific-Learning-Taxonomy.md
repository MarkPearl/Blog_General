Notes based off [Developing a Computer Computer Science specific Learning Taxonomy] paper.

Taxonomy 
- a way of classifying things to have a common language between people.
- can be used to define the curriculum objectives of a course so it is described in the level of understanding for each topic

Problems with Blooms Taxonomy
- did not find terms synthesis and evaluation useful in descriving learning outcomes and assesment tasks for programming courses, especially at introductory level
