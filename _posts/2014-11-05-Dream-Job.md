#### Why do we work ####

We probably want to live in modern society and that requires money.

#### How do you find my dream job ####

- Identify where you want to work  
- Network / market yourself  
- Establish your value by showing you are competent  
- Establishing credibility by speaking at user groups / conferences is probably easier than doing it online  
- Give people an opportunity to love you so much they want to work with you  
- Let people know you are available  
- Dont only spend time at technical groups - market yourself with business people / where hiring people gather  

#### Money ####

- Make sure you have enough money to fund the next job  

#### Responsibility ####

- You do not have the responsibility to make the business grow unless you have stock options  
- You do not have the responsibility to change the culture of the business unless you have stock options
