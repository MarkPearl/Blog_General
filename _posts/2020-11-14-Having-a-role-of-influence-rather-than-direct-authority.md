title: Having a role of influence rather than direct authority

Lately I've been looking at roles in our org. Some roles have direct reports, others don't. 
While behaviours are important regardless of whether you are in either role, they are magnified in roles where there is no direct authority.

Some things I've found to be useful are...
* showing respect to those you interact with regardless of their seniority in the organisition. 
* being able to navigate a tough situation without loosing your cool.
* practicing respectfull communication, you need to be able to challenge things directly without offending the person doing the things you are challenging.
