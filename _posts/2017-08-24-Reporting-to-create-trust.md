The other day I was in a meeting where I heard an intersting comment around reports.

The explanation was... "I can't look at your board because I can't understand it, you sending a standardized report every two weeks helps create trust".

I thought it was an interesting perspective. I've always felt that there is an element of lack of trust when people ask for certain reports, I have never thought about it from the opposite side that sending a report creates trust.

I still have mixed feelings on this...
