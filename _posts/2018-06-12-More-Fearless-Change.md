More Fearless Change is a patterns based book on introducing change in an organization. I found it extremely useful to read, it re-affirmed some patterns that I'm already comfortable with applying and highlighted some patterns that I need to work on.

I would recommend this book to anyone who is wanting to introduce a change to their organization.

Patterns that stood out the most:

* Inspire Others  
* Future Commitment  
* Myth Buster  
* Do Food

Going forward I would recommend that anyone wanting to introduce a change should go over the summary of the patterns to highlight the strategy they want to take.

Great read!
