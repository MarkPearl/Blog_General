So it has been almost two years since I had my letter read out on Dot Net Rocks. Richard & Carl promised to send me a mug – it was the going to be the highlight of the quarter and bragging rights in the office… but… the mug never came… ;-( I tried emailing them to find out if they sent it, but no response. After my second email and a year of waiting I eventually came to grips with the fact that I would continue to be using my plain white mug…

Then yesterday I got a note from the Post Office that a package was waiting for me… having forgotten that I had won a GWB TShirt and having thought it had gone the way of my DNR Mug, imagine my joy when I unwrapped the package to discover a perfect fitting tshirt with the GWB logo and my url.

Yay!!! Thank You GWB.
