We often hear about how dangerous duplication is in code. "You don't want any duplication in code, it is gonna introduces bugs" I've often been told, and for many years I believed that. Whenever I saw duplicate code I would extract it into a module or class. That was until I came across the book "[Understanding the 4 rules of simple design](https://leanpub.com/4rulesofsimpledesign)". Corey Haines, the author of this little gem, tackles the concept of naive duplication and DRY.

So what is DRY? Going back to the original definition we have...

> Every piece of knowledge has one and only one representation

Corey points out that it doesn't say anything about code. In fact, DRY has very little to do with code. Combining code that appears similar misses the point!

Sandi Metz, another software developer to follow,  has also said a similar thing when she wrote on her [blog](https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction) about duplication.
