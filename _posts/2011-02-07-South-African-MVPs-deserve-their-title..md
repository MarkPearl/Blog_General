Recently I read a post by someone who felt the Microsoft MVP program had failed. My local experience with the MVP program would tend for me to disagree. On Saturday I attended a free Windows Phone 7 event organized by Robert MacLean and Rudi Grobler both of whom are local MVP’s.

First of all, kudos to them for organizing the event which included a free lunch and flash stick and had some great content for a free event. Secondly, this is not the first time that either of these two MVP’s have organized events. They are active in the community, present at the majority of local events and are always approachable and give an “honest” opinion.

For me, that is what an MVP stands for and at least in my region I feel that the MVP program is a real success.
