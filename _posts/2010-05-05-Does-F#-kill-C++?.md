title: Does F# kill C++?

Okay, so the title may be a little misleading… but I am currently travelling and so have had very little time and access to resources to do much fsharping – this has meant that I am right now missing my favourite new language. I was interested to see [this post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2752229/f-performance-in-scientific-computing) on Stack Overflow this evening concerning the performance of the F# language.

The person posing the question asked 8 key points about the F# language, namely…

How well does it do floating-point?
Does it allow vector instructions
How friendly is it towards optimizing compilers?
How big a memory foot print does it have?
Does it allow fine-grained control over memory locality?
Does it have capacity for distributed memory processors, for example Cray?
What features does it have that may be of interest to computational science where heavy number processing is involved?
Are there actual scientific computing implementations that use it?
Now, I don’t have much time to look into a decent response and to be honest I don’t know half of the answers to what he is asking, but it was interesting to see what was put up as an answer so far and would be interesting to get other peoples feedback on these questions if they know of anything other than what has been covered in the answer section already.
