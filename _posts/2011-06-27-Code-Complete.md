This book extensively covers the construction aspect of programming. I started off not agreeing with many of the minor points that were illustrated, but after sticking with the book it got better and better. It touches so many areas, some in detail, some just lightly - I am sure due to the volume of the information presented I missed many of the finer points but I would recommend every developer read this book at least twice, once to cover the breadth of the content and then one more time to cover the details.
