Often the beauty of code is in it being succint without loosing it's meaning. 

Compare the following two equivalent poems... see which one holds more beauty to you?

### Poem 1

~~~
What life is like in Harlem  

What happens to a dream that has been deferred for a time?  
Does it dry up  
Like the way a raisin does when it's in the sun for a while?  
Or does it fester like the way an ugly sore would -   
And then after that does it run and run?  
Does it stink like rotten meat would smell to you?  
Or does it sort of crust and sugar over - you know -  
Like the way a syrupy sweet would?  
Maybe though it just sags in a downward motion  
Like the way a heavy load would sag.  
Or does it on the other hand explode like a bomb would?

### Poem 2

~~~
Harlem

What happens to a dream deferred?

      Does it dry up
      like a raisin in the sun?
      Or fester like a sore—
      And then run?
      Does it stink like rotten meat?
      Or crust and sugar over—
      like a syrupy sweet?

      Maybe it just sags
      like a heavy load.

      Or does it explode?

Removing fifty nine unnecessary words reduces the text from 113 to 54 words and uncovers a great poem.
