Think back to someone you've worked with that you thought was a great software engineer.

Great software engineers are people who are passionate about their jobs and are continously improving; who develop and maintain practical decision making models based on theory and expertise; who grow their capability to produce software that is elegant, creative, and anticipate needs; who evaluate tradeoffs at multiple levels of abstraction, from low-level technical details to big picture strategies; and whom teammates trust and enjoy working with.

With personal characteristics many felt that the attributes were intrinsic to the person-formed through their upbringing-and were difficult (if not impossible to change).
