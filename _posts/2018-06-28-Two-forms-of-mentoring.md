My first intentional experience around mentorship in software development began in June 2014 - I know because I made a note about it which I still have. 
The note said that "formal mentorship" was new to us (the us being the small consultancy I worked for), that as a company we were not exactly sure how mentorship worked but were open to experimentation. It went on to say that as a first experiment everyone in the company would pick someone else as their mentor and set up a regular meeting with them to be mentored. It ended with the commitment that after a few months we would get back together as a group and give feedback on what we had learned. 

I can't remember if we ever did get back together to review how the first experiment with mentorship went. What I do remember is the experience I had with my mentor---the activity was deeply fulfilling. We met weekly and discussed all things software related. Those conversations have helped shape many of the views I have today on how to make software. Since that initial mentorship experience I've had several opportunities to set up software mentoring relationships. 

In the next few months I would like to document so of the learning's I've had around software mentorship. I want to do this to provide a "thinking pad" to bounce ideas off others and to gain insights into where my thinking can be enhanced.

## Two forms of mentorship 

The word "mentorship" is a loaded word, it means different things in different contexts to different people. I've seen software mentorship takes on two main forms:

1) Skills mentoring  
2) Mindset mentoring   

### Skills Mentoring

With skills mentoring there is a specific skill or practice you want to learn that the someone else has already mastered, for example learning how to do TDD. In my experience skills mentoring works best when there is a roadmap or a journey the mentor has in mind. With TDD, for example, the roadmap may be to do a set of increasingly complex coding problems. The mentor reviews and guides the mentee through the roadmap making sure the most important concepts of the skill are learnt. At times when the mentee has not understood a particular concept the mentor will take the mentee back to that concept and try alternative approaches until the mentee gets it. With skills mentoring there is a clear goal and thus a clear end point---learning the skill. When the mentee understands and can apply the skill the mentors job is over. 

### Mindset Mentoring  

With mindset mentoring there isn't a specific skill the mentee is learning or a roadmap they are being guided through, rather the mentee is looking for solid advice from someone they respect and trust --- their mentor. Usually the mentor has previous experience in doing the work the mentee is learning. The mentor offers personal support. They usually share what they have done in the past in similar circumstances and help the mentee think through their options. One of the challenges with this form of mentorship is that it doesn't have a clear end point, because there is no roadmap it can drag out longer than it needs to. I recommend in this type of mentoring relationship you use the review and renew approach. Upfront you commit to a set time period to meet for, say you agree to once every two weeks for two months. You make it clear that at the end of the two months you will evaluate if there is still value in the mentoring relationship and either review and adjust, or renew for another two months. I've found explicitly agreeing to this upfront removes some of the awkwardness around
