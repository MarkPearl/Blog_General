#### All models are wrong, some are useful ####

While the statistician George Box is generally attributed with the statement, **"All models are wrong, but some are useful"**, my first encounter with this statement was when I was starting in a coaching role at Driven Alliance and was in a informal training session with [Danie Roux](https://twitter.com/danieroux) & [Kevin Tretheway](https://twitter.com/KevinTrethewey). At the time they were emphasizing why we have models and why we need to be open to them being flawed.
