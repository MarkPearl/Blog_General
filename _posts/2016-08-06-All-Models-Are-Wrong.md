#### All models are wrong, some are useful ####

While the statistician George Box is generally attributed with the statement, **"All models are wrong, but some are useful"**, my first encounter with it was when I was starting in a coaching role at Driven Alliance and was in a informal training session with [Danie Roux](https://twitter.com/danieroux) & [Kevin Tretheway](https://twitter.com/KevinTrethewey). 

At the time we were looking at various models for understanding team behavior. Danie & Kevin were trying to get across as strongly as they could that while the model we were looking at was useful (if I remember right it was probably Tuckmans model), it was still fundamentally an over-simplification. As they explained, all models are a simplification - that's why they are models. In being a simplification it makes it easier for one to grasp certain concepts without getting overwhelmed by the complexity of the actual problem.
