#### All models are wrong, some models are useful ####

While the statistician George Box is generally attributed with the statement, **"All models are wrong, but some are useful"**, my first encounter with it was when I was starting in a coaching role at Driven Alliance and was in a informal training session with [Danie Roux](https://twitter.com/danieroux) & [Kevin Tretheway](https://twitter.com/KevinTrethewey). 

At the time we were looking at various models for understanding and predicting team behavior. Danie & Kevin were trying to get across as strongly as they could that while the model we were looking at was useful (if I remember right it was probably [Tuckmans model](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/Tuckmans-Model)), it was fundamentally an over-simplification and thus wrong. 

As they explained, all models are simplifications - that's why they are models. The model makes it easier for a person to grasp certain concepts about the thing being modelled without getting overwhelmed by the complexity of the actual thing HOWEVER with the model being a simplification, it is also fundamentally wrong (there will always be instances where the model doesn't explain or predict the behavior correctly). Make sense?  

#### Models are useful when they are right ####

When is a model useful? Originally I thought models were useful when they were correctly explaining or predicting behavior. 

For instance, with Tuckmans model, I find it useful when I can look at a newly formed team and see that they are still "Norming". Being able to predict that the team will transition from a norming to a storming phase is also extremely useful.

While I still think models are useful when they are explaining or predicting things correctly, I've got a new angle on when a model is useful.

#### Some models are useful because they are clearly wrong ####

I'm finding some models are extremely useful because they are clearly wrong.
