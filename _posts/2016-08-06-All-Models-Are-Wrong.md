#### All models are wrong, some are useful ####

While the statistician George Box is generally attributed with the statement, **"All models are wrong, but some are useful"**, my first encounter with it was when I was starting in a coaching role at Driven Alliance and was in a informal training session with [Danie Roux](https://twitter.com/danieroux) & [Kevin Tretheway](https://twitter.com/KevinTrethewey). 

At the time we were looking at various models for understanding team behavior. Danie & Kevin were trying to get across as strongly as they could that while the model we were looking at was useful (if I remember right it was probably [Tuckmans model](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/Tuckmans-Model)), it was fundamentally an over-simplification. 

As they explained, all models are simplifications - that's why they are models. In being a simplification it makes it easier for a person to grasp certain concepts about the thing being modelled without getting overwhelmed by the complexity of the actual thing. Thus, all models are wring... some models are useful.

#### Some models are useful ####

When is a model useful? Originally I thought models were useful when the core concept was correct.
