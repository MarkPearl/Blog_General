title: Mob Programming Industry Survey Results 2017

In 2017 over a two month period I hosted a Online Mob Programming Survey with the aim to get a wider community perspective on Mob Programming. 

At the time I was working on a Mob Programming book and wanted to see if others had similar opinions and experiences with mobbing. It would help in me focussing my content and share deeper insights into the practice of mobbing.

My reasoning was as follows: there are groups of teams all over the world independently experimenting with Mob Programming. If there were patterns found amongst these independent groups it may help us find common themes that could further be investigated.

I had 82 responses to the survey.

- I've heard about it before but haven't actually done it yet
