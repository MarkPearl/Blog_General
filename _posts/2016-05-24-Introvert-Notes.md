#### Tips for Travelling ####

Smile when you see them for the first time
 
Travelling in a plane
If you have gum, offer them a stick of gum
If they talk to you and you have work to do engage with them in conversation for a few minutes
 
If you don’t want to talk to them the whole flight way to end it

Have a positive expression and tone
-          Well, it’s been great talking to you, I’ve promised myself I need to get some work done
-          Well, it’s been great talking to you

 
When the plane re-lands say goodbye
 
It takes more effort to undo a bad first impression than to make a good first impression
 
Be aware of the Halo effect
 
At the conference
-          As you walk into the conference for the first time shift your thinking on how you can make a positive impression on people around you
-          Don’t attend every event at a conference – you need downtime to re-charge

How to turn down invitations when you don’t want to go
-          Less is more
-          I’m going to go to bed early tonight
