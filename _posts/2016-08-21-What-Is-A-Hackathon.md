Recently I attended a 2 day long, company sponsored hackathon. It was a great experience - it says something to me when companies do things like this. This was not the first hackathon I have attended, last year at my previous client in South Africa, I attended a 24 hour hackathon which was also awesome. Having been to two events marketed as 'hackathons' from two very different companies I have a few insights and questions about events like this, I think they can all be put under the big umbrella question of:

> Why is the company doing this? What are they wanting to get out of this?
