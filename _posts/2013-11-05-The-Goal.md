A really good read!

Wow, what a great book. Looking back it's hard to summarize "The Goal" and do it justice. In a nutshell it's covers the basic concepts of Theory of Constraints but does it in such a way that it is entertaining and inspiring. The book is written like a novel, so while these powerfull concepts are being put forward you are also being entertained.

While the book focusses on manufacturing, the concepts can also be applied to team software development. Identify bottlenecks in your development cycle, remove unnecessary waste, reduce inventory and reduce time to market (time between releases).

I wish all books were written this way.
