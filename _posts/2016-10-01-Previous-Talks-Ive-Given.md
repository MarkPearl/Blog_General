Over the years I have had an opportunity to speak to a range of audiences - from a handful of people to hundreds. Some of these sessions have been recorded and can be viewed on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhqe1sLkgzJ-JoWNuHjk1W5fekvC88dFa).

I have found that speaking on things I have personal experience with leads to deeper insights for both myself and those in attendance.

I've had the opportunity to speak in the following cities around the world...  

- South Jordan, Utah, USA  
- Melbourne, Australia  
- Auckland, New Zealand
- Cape Town, South Africa  
- Durban, South Africa  
- Johannesburg, South Africa
