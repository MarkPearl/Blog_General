I found this book fairly limiting... it's main purpose is to bridge the gap from vb6 and c++ programmers moving into C# and at the time of its writing I am sure it was invaluable, however reading it a few years after publication one can see that it is dated. The authors naming conventions of objects is also frustrating and dated.

But, still a relatively good resource to read once and then throw away...
