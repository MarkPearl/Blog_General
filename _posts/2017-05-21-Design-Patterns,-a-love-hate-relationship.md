# Why we love them...

How often have you opened up a solution to see a clean separation of concerns, with clear use of creational, behavioural and structural patterns!

How about when you have a conversation with a colleague who is not familiar with the code base - without even seeing the code, design patterns enable the conversation, "here are our factories, here we have leveraged a singleton". All of a sudden conceptualising what is going on is so much easier.

Design patterns enable you to have a common terminology for discussing design situations and decisions, for this reason we love them!

# Why we hate them...

How many times has someone who has been recently introduced to design patterns felt the need to make all their code going forward use a recognized pattern. How often have they introduced unnecessary complexity, given people a false sense that they have done a good job and followed "best practices" and inflated the solution.

That's why we hate them!
