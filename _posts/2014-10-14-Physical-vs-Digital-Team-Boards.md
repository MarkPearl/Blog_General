- In some environments it is hard to find a suitable place to put it  
- Does not work well in distributed teams
- No history
- Policies for placing things on the board can be broken

#### Some discussions ####

A collegue of mine shared the following comments regarding digital team boards installed at a client.

I've reserved judgement until I see it running - it's not something I would have done, but I haven't seen one in action before.

I think it depends what you want a board for. If you think it is about measuring and reporting then a digital board makes it less work to do that. If you think it is about a lightweight representation of what your process looks like today, and where all the work is right now, then you'll be more inclined towards stickies on a whiteboard in your own work area. Physical boards can be tweaked constantly in real time by the people doing the work. 

The transaction cost of tweaking JIRA is just high enough that people won't do it - they will rely on the JIRA admin to know what is best, and now the team doesn't own their process anymore, they are letting the tool dictate it.

The board could be very useful for design sessions. Then again though, perhaps if you can't draw your design out on a whiteboard then you either don't know it well enough or it is too complicated.

Perhaps for distributed teams if they could see the same projection it might enable something interesting.

As I said, I've reserved judgment until I see it in action, I don't have high hopes.
