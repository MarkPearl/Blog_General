title: 6’ Code GIT Challenge – GET GIT
tags: 
category: General
---
It has been some time since I have had an hour or so to do a decent blog post, and finally today I sat down and decided I would just have to make the time. I am itching for some F# programming, but decided to first attempt the 6 Degree’s of Code Challenge that was extended by Garren at the last user group meeting.

In essence while Garren never mentioned it specifically, he gave us Euler Problem 3. Since I have already solved the problem in F#, I thought it would be a good idea to do the same thing in C#. The actual solution was relatively easy, but the real intention of the challenge was to get a bit of exposure to Git.

I must be honest, I have never worked with Git before – in fact the only exposure I have had to source code control has been SVN and that has only been at a superficial level. I installed tortoise, then installed visual SVN over that and hey presto… no command prompt.

Git Getting Started

It seems with GIT I am not going to get away from the command prompt. Not that I am scared of a console, but I have been spoilt with Windows applications and it has been some time since I have had a good bash at command line commands. As far as I understand, there are a few plugins that I can run that will put a UI over GIT, but at least initially I would like to get used to some of the raw basics, and then once I am familiar, or at least know that the commands exist, then I can look at hiding it all behind a UI.

There also seems like tons of resources/blogs on getting started with GIT. One that I read that was good for me can be found here…

A tour of git: the basics – by Carl Worth
I am going to be working on a Windows machine so I installed msysgit and did the basics that Carl Worth went through.

After going through the basics on Carl’s blog I found it covered pretty much everything I needed, except how to push changes from my local machine back to the live one. A little more googling and the following blog post really helped.

The keyword I was looking for was…

# git push origin master

All seemed fine, except Git was asking me for a passphrase when I tried to push my local version to Garrens account on GitHub. I eventually emailed Garren, so will wait and see what passphrase it is requiring.

Will update in a future blog…
