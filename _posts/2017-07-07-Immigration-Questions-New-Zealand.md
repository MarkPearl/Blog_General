# Bank Account

> I'll need to have a bank account open in NZ before I start work - should I (or can I even) get the ball rolling on that ahead of time?

* I opened a bank account the first day over. It took about 30 minutes.   
* I used my South African credit card before that.  
* You just need your passport and a letter from wherever you stay - a letter from your landlord or hotel is sufficient.  
* I would recommend only opening up a bank account when you arrive as an MYOB perk is that you have zero bank charges at ANZ.   

# Living Expenses

> What sort of living expenses can I expect?

We spend $6500 per month for a family of 4
Our biggest expense is housing, we pay $600 per month, typically you can get a place for between $550 & $650, but housing is tight and can be a challenge

# Container / Bringing your stuff over

> Should I bring my stuff over? Is it worth shipping major appliances and furniture? 

Fridges etc are significantly more expensive in NZ, if you have stuff you would like to bring over and can afford to do so I would recommend it. Be careful though, you may battle to get it to fit into your place, i.e. we brought a Fridge/Freezer combo over and were very very lucky we found a place that could accomodate it.

> Do you have any recommendations for shipping companies and scheduling this stuff?

# Car

What do cars cost?

Second hand cars are cheap in NZ. If you are happy with a japanese second hand car you will find many bargains. European cars tend to be more expensive

# Housing

What am I looking at for housing.

Finding a place to stay is a real challenge. There are many crappy New Zealand houses out there. Once you find a place to rent you need a deposit. We needed four weeks deposit to put down for a place which is a significant amount converted to rands and I had to spend time trying to find a place (it was $2400 = R24000 deposit).
Generally they won't rent a place to you before you have seen it so it is unlikely you will be able to sign a rental before you arrive.

# Most difficult adjustments

Most difficult adjustments were not having extended family around. We had to be really intentional about "putting ourselves out there" and meeting new people, taking every opportunity to interact. We still miss having close friends but are working at it. Housing was the other big adjustment, the houses are different here and it took time adjusting to that.

# Kids

## High School

Regarding high school, my understanding is there would be some sort of assessment done to establish where your kids were at educationally, and then they would put them in the appropriate class. I've had conversations with various friends with kids in high school, some have a great experience - others have it really tough. You would be eligible to apply to any high school zoned for your area. Different schools have different intake waiting times, so it would really depend on where you live. In general education is really good here.

# Selling House in SA

We sold our house before we left. My guess is if you sold it while in NZ you would just need to sign documents, it costs about R600 to get documents across.

# Working at MYOB

* Salary is paid monthly, around the 15th. 

* Dress code is casual, I wear Jeans and a TShirt, which is the norm. I would recommend stocking up on Jeans and Shirts before you leave, they are substantially more expensive in New Zealand as far as I can remember.
