This covered what I would call the "original" scrum concept. As someone trying to get a good introduction to scrum it was an enjoyable read however it did not cover in any real depth actual implementation and some of the concepts that it presented have changed or become more developed since then (i.e. its recommendation on a sprint being 30 days is now not the norm).
