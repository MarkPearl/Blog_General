title: C# soon to dethrone C++ as the third most popular language in the world

Every now and then I go to Tiobe to see their ratings on the popularity of programming languages. Usually there is nothing exciting out there, just a few small moves of languages so I was interested to see in December Tiobe had a headline of C++ about to be dethroned by C#

Looking at the stats, sure enough, according to Tiobe C# is on the verge of taking the number 3 spot.

It will be interesting to see what happens when Windows 8 hits the market with what seemed to be a revival of C++ during Microsoftâ€™s Build Conference earlier this year.

Also, with .Net coming prepackaged with Windows 8 and being available on the Windows Phone via Silverlight it should lead to an interesting battle to see who is able to hold the spot next year.
