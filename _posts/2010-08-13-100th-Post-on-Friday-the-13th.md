Today I make my 100th post to GeeksWithBlogs and it is Friday the 13’th… how interesting…

While my blog is a mix of F#, university summaries, and other ramblings – I must say I have really enjoyed being involved in the GWB community and keeping up to date with other bloggers.

Thanks for all those who have given me feedback on various blog posts and helped me learn… I look forward to your feedback in the future!
