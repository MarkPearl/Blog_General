Where I work we've been improving our graduate programme for software developers. Today I would like to share some of the insights we've gained over the last few years around how to do this better.

## How do I fit into this?

My involvement in our software developers graduate programme has evolved with time. It started as me being a part time volunteer that wanted to improve the experience for a specific participant. With time it's evolved to be a full-time role where I look after the programme across three cities with about 30 participants at any one time. In this post I would like to share some of the insights I've gained over the last few years around how to run a graduate programme for software developers better as well as the lessons we've learned on this journey.

## Why do we have a graduate programme

Before I get into the meat of what we've done and how we have evolved the programme, I want to briefly touch on why we are doing it in the first place. There are two main drivers.

1) It's fair to say that in my industry we have a scarcity of experienced software engineers available compared to the amount of work needed to be done.  
2) It's also fair to say that we have a major diversity problem in this experienced pool of people doing the work (I realize diversity can be measured on multiple dimensions, the most obvious one right now being gender diversity but there are others).  

Our graduate programme allowed us to tackle these two areas simultaneously. We were able to tap into the vast talent pool of brilliant people wanting to enter the software engineering field that just didn't have enough experience AND in tapping into this pool we've found that there is way more diversity on many different dimensions. 

The net result is our graduate programme has allowed us to intentionally bring diversity in to our engineering teams which I believe will result in us making better software.

## Evolution of high level programme

To start off with, I want to share how our programme has evolved.

## Simple rotation 

We started off with a very simple rigid structure. 

* We worked on a 1 graduate per team rule. 
* Every 3 months each graduate would move to a new team. 

### Summary of adjustments

This simple approach had low management overheard. The experience however was hit and miss. 

One of the biggest challenges I saw with this approach was as a graduate your growth was largely dependent on the team you join and how experienced they are with growing someone. Our engineering teams had very little experience working with people newer in their careers and supporting them adequately.

Some teams had a complex domain that required serious up skilling. I questioned how much someone learned from the experience in just 3 months.

## Simple rotation with shared intentional learning workshops

Our next adjustment was to introduce learning workshops. Once a week we would get all the graduates together an afternoon to go through a fundamental software development concept. They would then have a 'synthetic problem' to do on their own to help apply that concept. 

### Summary of adjustments

The addition of the weekly workshop helped us form a baseline for where people were at technically. One challenge we found with this approach was graduates being able to make time to do the synthetic problems during the week. Some weeks they were able to do the work, other weeks they were unable to prioritize it. Another challenge was being able to tie up what they were learning in the workshops to the actual work they were doing. Because we had a fragmented software engineering practices some teams did not value practices like TDD, or making things testable due to ignorance or lack of understanding.

## Introduction of learning phase before team rotations

The next adjustment was probably the biggest. We introduced a learning phase before graduates entered team rotations. The intention with the learning phase was to give graduates foundational technical skills that they would use regardless of the team they joined. 

During the learning phase graduates would work a collection of software engineering practices that we had identified as important to us as an organisation. We provided a handful of synthetic problems that the mentors could use to help their graduates learn. Mentors worked either as solo or co-mentors. We introduced the concept of "meta" mentors who were there to help new mentors figure out what mentoring meant.

At the end of the learning phase the graduates would participate in a "meaningful project" and them move into team rotations.

We also adjusted the policy for team rotations so that graduates could spend between 3 and 6 months in a team instead of a fixed 3 month rotation. This allowed one to stay longer in a team if you were still learning.

### Summary of adjustments

The learning phase while useful was chaotic. Not enough guidance was given to mentors on how to develop certain skills and some of them were not experienced enough to teach these skills. There was also no bar on what "good enough" mean. Some graduates spent a fairly lengthy time in the learning phase because their mentors had higher standards of what they expected than other mentors. The idea of meta mentors never really took off. Some meta mentors met up regularly with their groups, other meta mentors preferred to get involved directly with the graduates.

Allowing varying the crew rotations created some complications on how to plan workforce planning but seemed to still be positive as graduates felt in more control of their learning journey.

### Summary of adjustments

## Third structure

- Dedicated period before going to teams
- Work under guidance of co-mentors
- Them spend varying times at different teams, make clear what the goal is
- Produce guidebooks to give guidance on roles
- Introduce workshops for mentors to drive more alignment
- Mentoring circles led by a single person
