Where I work we've been improving our graduate programme for software developers. Today I would like to share some of the insights we've gained over the last few years around how to do this better.

## How do I fit into this?

My involvement in our graduate has evolved with time. It started as a part time volunteer to help improve the experience. Since then it's evolved to be a fulltime dedicated role. In this post I would like to share some of the insights I've gained over the last few years around how to do this better.

## Why do we have a graduate programme

Before I get into what we've done I want to briefly touch on why we have a graduate software developer programme. 

* Scarcity of experienced software engineers
* Allows us to focus on culture
* Allows us to intentionally address diversity
* Technical skills are just one element that make a great software developer

## First structure

- People in teams rotating every 3 months
- One afternoon a week would come to the academy and work on synthetic problems to improve their craft

## Second structure

- Dedicated period before going to teams, would work under the guidance of dedicated mentors
- Mix of solo and co-mentors
- Project at the end, not meant to be a race but want people to go through at their own pace
- Them spend varying times at different teams learning how to contribute
- Mentoring circles led by meta mentors

## Third structure

- Dedicated period before going to teams
- Work under guidance of co-mentors
- Them spend varying times at different teams, make clear what the goal is
- Produce guidebooks to give guidance on roles
- Introduce workshops for mentors to drive more alignment
- Mentoring circles led by a single person
