Where I work we've been improving our graduate programme for software developers. Today I would like to share some of the insights we've gained over the last few years around how to do this better.

## How do I fit into this?

My involvement in our software developers graduate programme has evolved with time. It started as a part time volunteer who rolled up their sleeves to help improve the experience for a specific participant that wasn't having such a great time. With time it's evolved to be a fulltime dedicated role where I look after the programme across three cities. In this post I would like to share some of the insights I've gained over the last few years around how to run a graduate programme for software developers better.

## Why do we have a graduate programme

Before I get into the meat of what we've done and how we have evolved the programme, I want to briefly touch on why we are doing it in the first place. There are two main drivers.

1) It's fair to say that in my industry we have a scarcity of experienced software engineers available compared to the amount of work needed to be done. 
2) It's also fair to say that we have a major diversity problem in this experienced pool of people doing the work (I realize diversity can be measured on multiple dimensions, the most obvious one right now being gender diversity but there are others). 

Our graduate programme allowed us to tackle these two dimensions simulataneously. We were able to tap into the vast talent pool of brilliant people wanting to enter the software engineering field that just didn't have enough experience AND in tapping into this pool we've found that there is way more diversity on many different dimensions. 

The net result is our graduate programme has allowed us to intentionally bring diversity in to our engineering teams which I believe will result in us making better software.

## Evolution of high level programme

To start off with, I want to share how our programme has evolved.

## Simple rotation 

We started off with a very simple rigid structure. We worked on a 1 graduate per team rule. Every 3 months graduates would need to move teams. This had low management overheard however the experience was hit and miss. As a graduate your growth was dependent on the team you joined and how experienced they were with growing someone. Some teams had a complex domain that required serious upskilling. I questioned how much someone learned from the experience in just 3 months.

## Simple rotation with intentional learning workshops

At one stage we began introducing learning workshops. Once a week we would get all the graduates together and go through a fundamental concept. They would then have a 'synthetic problem' to do on their own to help apply that concept. 


## Second structure

- Dedicated period before going to teams, would work under the guidance of dedicated mentors
- Mix of solo and co-mentors
- Project at the end, not meant to be a race but want people to go through at their own pace
- Them spend varying times at different teams learning how to contribute
- Mentoring circles led by meta mentors

## Third structure

- Dedicated period before going to teams
- Work under guidance of co-mentors
- Them spend varying times at different teams, make clear what the goal is
- Produce guidebooks to give guidance on roles
- Introduce workshops for mentors to drive more alignment
- Mentoring circles led by a single person
