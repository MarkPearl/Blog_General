## Why do we have a graduate programme

* Scarcity of experienced osftware engineers
* Allows us to focus on culture
* Allows ut to intentionally address diversity
* Technical skills are just one element that make a great software developer

## Our first attempt at a programme

- People in teams rotating every 3 months
- One afternoon a week would come to the academy and work on sythetic problems to improve their craft

## Our second attempt at mentoring

- Dedicated period before going to teams, would work under the guidance of dedicated mentors
- Mix of solo and co-mentors
- Project at the end, not meant to be a race but want people to go through at their own pace
- Them spend varying times at different teams learning how to contribute
- Mentoring circles led by meta mentors

## Third attempt

- Dedicated period before going to teams
- Work under guidance of co-mentors
- Them spend varying times at different teams, make clear what the goal is
- Produce guidebooks to give guidance on roles
- Introduce workshops for mentors to drive more allignment
- Mentoring circles led by a single person
