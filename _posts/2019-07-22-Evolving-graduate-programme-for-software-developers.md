Where I work we've been improving our graduate programme for software developers. Today I would like to share some of the insights we've gained over the last few years around how to do this better.

## How do I fit into this?

My involvement in our software developers graduate programme has evolved with time. It started as a part time volunteer who rolled up their sleeves to help improve the experience for a specific participant that wasn't having such a great time. With time it's evolved to be a fulltime dedicated role where I look after the programme across three cities. In this post I would like to share some of the insights I've gained over the last few years around how to run a graduate programme for software developers better.

## Why do we have a graduate programme

Before I get into the meat of what we've done, I want to briefly touch on why we are doing it in the first place. It's fair to say that in my industry there is a scarcity of experienced software engineers compared to the work needed to be done. It's also fair to say that we have a major diversity problem in this experienced pool of people doing the work (I realize diversity can be measured on multiple dimensions, the most obvious one right now being gender diversity but there are others). 

Our graduate programme allowed us to tap into the vast talent pool of brilliant people wanting to enter the software engineering field that just din't have enough industry experience. In tapping into this pool I've found that there is way more diversity. This has allowed us to intentionally bring people in diversity to our engineering teams. I believe this diversity has led to better balanced teams that make better software. 

As I mentioned in a [previous post](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/Evolving-approach-to-interviewing-graduate-software-developers), good practices in software construction is just one element of makes a great software developer.

## First structure

- People in teams rotating every 3 months
- One afternoon a week would come to the academy and work on synthetic problems to improve their craft

## Second structure

- Dedicated period before going to teams, would work under the guidance of dedicated mentors
- Mix of solo and co-mentors
- Project at the end, not meant to be a race but want people to go through at their own pace
- Them spend varying times at different teams learning how to contribute
- Mentoring circles led by meta mentors

## Third structure

- Dedicated period before going to teams
- Work under guidance of co-mentors
- Them spend varying times at different teams, make clear what the goal is
- Produce guidebooks to give guidance on roles
- Introduce workshops for mentors to drive more alignment
- Mentoring circles led by a single person
