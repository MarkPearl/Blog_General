An interesting observation from [Martin Cronje](https://twitter.com/martincronje) recently was something I have dubbed "the maintainability distinction".

> All qualities except maintainability are optional as they address user needs. The trade-off on maintainability should never be a product owner or user decision since they are not the people that directly experience the lack thereof
