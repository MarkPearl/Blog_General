This post is aimed at collecting notes around software apprenticeships. 

# What do we mean by software apprenticeships?

The word "Apprenticeship" comes from the Old French aprentiz meaning "someone learning" and the Anglian suffix -scip, meaning "state, condition of being." An appenticeship is when someone is in a state or condition of learning from a "master" in a field. 

While software apprenticeships are relatively uncommon, in several other professions the concept of an apprenticeship is a common (i.e. electricians).

So why software apprenticeships? 

* Experience is valuable and hard to learn through a book  
* Our industry has varying standards, what may be considered an acceptable level and appropriate practices for one organization would be considered sub-par or inappropriate for another  
* Most academic institutions are still not equiping students with the necessary skills to be professional software engineers  

# How do we want people to learn?

We want apprentices to learn in multiple ways:

* Hands on while doing the work with more experienced practitioners either pairing or mobbing
* Formal education points
* Growing mindset

# Mentors

It starts with a mentor, someone who has more experience and is willing to share that experience with a mentee. Mentors should be committed to mentoring. This means they should be dedicating time each week to their mentee.

How much time is enough time? 

Mentors should be skilled in the feedback process.

People starting out need a mentor. Mentoring takes effort.
