There are software development teams spread across the world that are doing amazing things. 

Some of the things I seen in different teams in different organizations include:

- teams that have been able to intentionally create an amazing culture.  
- teams that have done unique things to represent the work they do collaboratively.  
- teams that have deep technical skills developed through mentorship or intential learning.  
- teams that have raised the level of collaboration by pushing the boundaries of mobbing.  
- teams that have figured out how to hire properly.

The challenge I've seen in our industry is that we have pockets of briliance, but it's all disconnected. We need to fix that!

So how are we currently connecting these pockets of excellence? 

Currently I see two approaches:

1) Pay the guru consultant to come and visit. They spend a few days sharing their wisdom with the team, before moving on to the next team.
2) Hire the new employees who bring some of the "magic sauce" with them from their previous employers.

I don't think either approach is great. The guru is expensive, the hire is permanent. Both approaches don't encourage regular sharing. I think there is a better way. We've called it "Team Tourism" although I would love a better name for it.

#### What is Team Tourism ####

Team tourism is the idea that every once in a while we need to get out of our specific team and be a tourist with another team with the intention of openly sharing. The person touring has just as much responsbility in sharing as the team being toured. 

#### Why is this a better way? ####

Natural cross polination - ideas and practices get shared across team and organizational boundaries, allowing for the "good" to be shared

#### How long should a tourist vissit? ####

Typically I've found two to three day's is great.
