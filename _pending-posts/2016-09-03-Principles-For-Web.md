#### Guiding Principles

- Complexity on the Server is better than complexity on the client  
- Integrate early

#### Things to agree on 

- An architectures that enables both teams to work NOW on the system is preferred over an architecture that requires one team to WAIT an indefinite period of time for the other team to provide further functionality.
