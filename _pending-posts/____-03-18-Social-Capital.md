#### What is Social Capital ####

<Kevin> 

Words are tricky things. Trust to me could mean something different than to you. How trust is *demonstrated* for you is almost certainly going to be different. 

For me, if I can predict what you are going to do, then I can trust you. I may not like it, but like and trust are different things to me. 

Perhaps if you define 'trust' for you, I can give you more useful opinion on how it might be achieved. I'm not sure seeking a universal definition is either useful, or even possible.

I can give you a short story of something that happened with me a while back, use it or don't :)

I was playing on first base for a baseball team and often the catcher/pitcher would not throw the ball to me to get someone out at first base. After a few games I took them one side and asked why they wouldn't throw to me. It turned out that they didn't trust me enough to catch the ball and hold on it and to tag the runner out.

Instead of being offended and angry at their lack of trust, I asked them to spend extra time throwing at me after practice each week so we could build that trust. Worked like a dream, by the end of the season they weren't evening hesistating to throw.

I think it all boils down to courage and communication.

Hope it helps in some way :)

In this very specific case maybe a very specific definition would be...

trust is when I am confident to speak to people verbally instead of relying solely on email for need of proof that a conversation occurred.

Lack of trust...

emailing people so that I have proof a conversation occurred and that someone can't come back and tell me it didn't when things go wrong.

Make sense?

Hey Mark,

It's an interesting thing that memory is not a reliable source of data, and people can be quite insistent that something did or did not take place, and sometimes the details of past events can be mixed up with others when we remember.

To add to that and speak to what Kevin said about meaning being different for different people, we often make different assumptions at the end of a conversation than the next person. Or, we simply don't recall it. People might also have only paid attention to certain details and not others.

So, to come back to trust, I ask two questions :

1. Are you suggesting that people are being dishonest when they don't recall the same thing you do? 
2. Assuming that someone genuinely has no recollection of a conversation, are you expecting trust to include this person taking your word for it because they trust you?

Hi Candice

I agree that when a conversation happens, the understanding from the people can be totally different. What I have observed is that in some scenarios there is a high frequency where people recall differently on whether a conversation happened at all and what the outcome of it was - in particular the magic sauce seems to be when the conversation is under scrutiny of someone they report to and there are consequences to the conversation and the content. When there are no consequences, they seem to have a much better recall. 

To answer your questions..

1. No, unless they do recall the same thing but decide it is not good for them to "remember" it.
2. No, if a person does not recall the conversation they do not need to take your word for it.
