Over time I've noticed a very important ingredient to successful software development. When it is there, things go great, when it is missing life becomes very painful. For want of a better word I'm call it 'trust'.

#### What do I mean by trust ####

Words are tricky things. Trust means different things to different people. Instead of trying to get a dictionary perfect definition of it - I would like to illustrate what I mean using an example.

I once worked in an environment where people were always checking their backs. When things went wrong, someone would get be blamed. To protect yourself from being the 'victim', you would always make sure you had documented proof that you did the right thing.

For instance, a developer would speak to their manager about a bug in the system. The manager would say it was fine and that it did not need to be fixed. Following the conversation the developer would email the manager so that there was documented proof that the conversation happened because in the past the manager would fein ignorance.

I understand that sometimes people genuinely have no recollections of conversations, or things get mixed up. People can be totally different. What I have observed is that in some scenarios there is a high frequency where people recall differently on whether a conversation happened at all and what the outcome of it was - in particular the magic sauce seems to be when the conversation is under scrutiny of someone they report to and there are consequences to the conversation and the content. When there are no consequences, they seem to have a much better recall. 

To answer your questions..

1. No, unless they do recall the same thing but decide it is not good for them to "remember" it.
2. No, if a person does not recall the conversation they do not need to take your word for it.

Words are tricky things. Trust to me could mean something different than to you. How trust is *demonstrated* for you is almost certainly going to be different. 

For me, if I can predict what you are going to do, then I can trust you. I may not like it, but like and trust are different things to me. 

Perhaps if you define 'trust' for you, I can give you more useful opinion on how it might be achieved. I'm not sure seeking a universal definition is either useful, or even possible.

I can give you a short story of something that happened with me a while back, use it or don't :)

I was playing on first base for a baseball team and often the catcher/pitcher would not throw the ball to me to get someone out at first base. After a few games I took them one side and asked why they wouldn't throw to me. It turned out that they didn't trust me enough to catch the ball and hold on it and to tag the runner out.

Instead of being offended and angry at their lack of trust, I asked them to spend extra time throwing at me after practice each week so we could build that trust. Worked like a dream, by the end of the season they weren't evening hesistating to throw.

I think it all boils down to courage and communication.

Hope it helps in some way :)

Building Trust
I've never built trust without giving it away first. I've never built trust quickly, but rather I've always built it steadily over time. It often starts—once again—with expressing genuine interest in understanding the other people's point of view and a willingness to help them get what they need from a situation, while also sharing what I need to get from the situation. The discussion might start like this.

I notice that we're not writing tests for all our features. I'm worried that if we only write tests for some of our features, then we're going to have false confidence in our code, and that seems like a recipe for anything form embarrassment to disaster. I need us to discuss this so that I can feel more settled about the situation. I'd like to help, if I can. Can we talk about what's causing us not to write these tests?

If no-one's willing to talk about it, then maybe there's a much deeper trust problem. Or maybe they just don't see the tests as useful because some other problem is the bottleneck. The distributed nature of the team means developing trust more slowly and with greater difficulty. The possibilities branch so much at this point, I can't cover them all in a short article. I think that what matters most is opening the discussion, inviting others to join it, and treating everyone well. Start by trusting everyone to care about the problem and try to improve things, then see what happens.

For someone in this situation, you can read some books, starting with the ones I list below in the references, or you can push the fast-forward button by hiring me to help mediate the discussion or to coach you through doing it yourself. People who join my consulting circle get timely answers to their questions and can hire me for real-time coaching on an as-needed basis.
