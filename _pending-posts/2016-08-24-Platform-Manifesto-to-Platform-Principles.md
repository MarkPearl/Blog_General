title: Platform Manifesto vs Platform Principles  
tags: Design
category: General
---

- Provide resuable functionality to other consuming products and services (Be unique, independent & resilient of others)  
- Accessible via a consistent manner by our products, services & clients 
- Built to be secure, to scale and to be easily operated by ourselves  
- Built for todays use, however designed for future evolutionary needs  
- Be proliferated though our products and services via reuse, rarely rebuilt or duplicated
- Supported by base core platform services and third-party supplier products  

### Manifesto

- Medium term thinking over short term thinking  
- Existing experiences over different variations  
- Capabilities as services over monolith extensions  
- Existing assets over new development  
- Nurture the platform over feature delivery  
- Automation over manual repetition  
- Asynchronous interactions over synchronous coupling  
- Stable technologies over the unproven  
- The greater good over individual objectives

### Principles 

- Always build functionality as independent re-usable services, accessible via an API
- Always re-use or consume services via their API's  
- Always design services to support asynchronous interactions  
- Everything that is repeated is automated  
- Everything must be build secure  
- Everything must be tested  
- Everything is built to be centrally monitored and audited  
- Everything is logged to a central service
