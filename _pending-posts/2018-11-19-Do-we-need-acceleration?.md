title: Do we need acceleration?

For those that don't know, I currently lead our graduate software developer programme. Our current programme has two parts to it... the first part is around covering some of the concepts we value like TDD, 4 rules of simple design, etc. The second part consists of crew rotations. This was some of the feedback I got when we originally presented the programme to the current graduates. The feedback is around acceleration material...

The overwhelming response from the current graduate group is that new proteges will be missing out on the full experience if they aren’t working on real projects within established teams. There were two main reasons behind this.

Firstly, they stated that after coming from several years of structured university learning, being placed into another heavily structured program would have frustrated and bored them. It’s important to remember that these proteges are not coming in as completely blank slates, and in fact, have been training for a job like this at university and through internships. The current cohort said that by the time they came to the graduate program, they were very much looking forward to putting all the skills they’d learnt into practice by creating something of value for the company. This is a really attractive part of being in a graduate program at a company like ours - we are given that freedom and opportunity to be a part of the company culture and shared mission. While current grads felt that occasionally they were slowing their team down with their lack of product knowledge, being thrown in the deep end allowed them to learn faster and made them feel accomplished. This was even a key factor in their decision to join us.
 
This leads into the second idea - current graduates were concerned about the silo that this may create for the new proteges, only working with each other without the guidance of more experienced developers. One of the people present explained this in a very succinct way - When they were embedded in a team, they felt comfortable asking for help with their work because it was contributing to the larger team goal, and therefore the goals of other developers in their team. Now, this person is working on their own individual project that doesn’t go towards the team’s mission. Because it isn’t a part of this shared goal, they feel less comfortable asking for help, and like they are bothering the team. A really important skill at our company is collaboration, and the current graduates are worried that losing the opportunity to work towards a shared mission is reducing this capacity or opportunity. Again, the opportunity to collaborate with experienced developers is one of the key attractions of joining us.

While I believe I understand the feelings and concerns being expressed by them, here are some reasons why we kept "acceleration".

1. Current practices are varied across the organisation. Several skills are fragmented, with pockets of excellence and pockets of mediocrity. This was achieved by using the current model of join a team and learn organically from the group. If we continue to do that we continue to get the same fragmentation.

2. We are not only going to be taking "university graduates" in, while some may have years of structured learning and be ready to join crews, for others this may be too big a leap. If we are going to address some of the diversity challenges we face we need a way to get more than what just the current univeristy market offers. This means we may need further upskill

3. If done right we should have a model that allows those that are "ready" for crews to move fast, and those that need a little more upfront investment in skills before joining a crew move slower. Acceleration gives us that buffer.

Will we always have the accleration part? I'm not sure, I can imagine that if our teams do not have fragmentation in skills and have a strong mentoring focus then putting grads straight into teams may be a good approach. That said, having a way to get a solid foundation upfront is extremely valuable. Acceleration also clearly removes the "you need to deliver" mindset and makes it clear that someone is in "learning" mode. That may or may not be a correct mindset.
