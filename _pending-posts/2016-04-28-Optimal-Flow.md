The attached graph does a better job of the point I was trying to get across this morning. 

Watch how the behaviour of the system changes as density (WIP) increases. If you look at the graph you will see:
Speed decreases as density increases (counterintuitive?)
Optimum flow is at a speed of 60km/h and density of 250cars/km (not at max speed or max density)
Beyond optimum flow the system rapidly becomes unpredictable and flow rate nosedives.

From this you can see that by simply controlling WIP (density) you will get more work through the team. If you do this whilst actively removing bottlenecks then you will see a huge performance gain for zero extra effort (in fact it will be less effort).

Something to think about...

On a personal note...

In KeyBlade our WIP came down to pretty much 1 since we have been mobbing. 

Since the beginning of time at Keyblade we have been pushing / cajoling / pleading / retroing on how to reduce wip with limited success always hitting a ceiling of about 4 items, and then magically without any focus on WIP we hit one.

I suspect chasing reduced WIP can be compared to chasing test coverage. 

If you chase test coverage without adapting practices to adopt TDD it adds very little value and is a painful experience. The second you change the practice to do the right thing, the metric sorts itself out.
