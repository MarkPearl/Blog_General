A theory for software teams
 
 
Keep in mind, All models are wrong, some are more useful than others.
 
Historically we have seen this over and over again.
 
Two well known models that were wrong were…
-          World is flat model

-          Miasma theory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory)

 
There are several models used to describe software development. These models help us understand core concepts of software development.
 
There are 4 questions that are useful to answer to understand software development better.
 
1)      Hire

2)      Turnover

3)      Performance

4)      Growth

 
 
Two popular models that we can use to try and answer these 4 questions are the factory model and the craftsmanship model.
 
The factory model has a perspective that
-          We build something

-          We ship it

-          We maintain it

 
A criticism of the factory model is that people are invisible – in essence it allows people to be interchangeable. Because people are invisible, it doesn’t tackle the 4 questions
 
The craftsmanship model has a perspective that people work in guilds. This model can help address the first 2 of the 4 questions.
 
It however doesn’t answer question 3 or 4
 
** A new model **
 
There is a new model that can help us answer all 4 questions. It’s called the Play Model of software development. It was first introduced by Sarah Mei, you can see several presentations she has done on it.
 
Our code was great, project failed
 
Get stuff done that matters
Communicate well
Solve real problems
