Look at the two recordings below of people competing in a type racer competion. Who do you think is typing faster?

Most people would choose recording A - the fingers are obviously pressing more keys and pressing them faster - pressing more keys surely means you are typing faster?

The reality is that the recording B is faster. Let me elaborate. Typing speed is not just about how quickly you press keys. It is also linked to your accuracy.

Someone who pressed 100 keys a minute but gets every second key wrong is "slower" than someone who presses 51 keys a minute but gets 100% accuracy.

Total speed is connected to accuracy.

I draw parallels between typing speed and software development.

How fast do you write software? Is it the speed that you church out code?

The reality is that the speed of software development is connected to the 'quality' of the code being written.

A team that churns out code but has quality issues is ultimately a lot slower than a team that methodically produces high quality code.


Over the last 4 years I've made a concerted effort at increasing my typing speed. I've used several tools to do this - typemaster, typing.io & typeracer. Four years ago when I started focussing on my typing speed I averaged about 30 wpm - now I'm averaging in the 80 wpm's.

One of the traditions the team I am currently in has is that twice a day we have a mini team type challenge - we race against eachother to see who the "champion" of the day is.
