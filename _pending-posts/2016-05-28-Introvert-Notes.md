#### Tips for Travelling ####

Smile when you see them for the first time
 
Travelling in a plane
If you have gum, offer them a stick of gum
If they talk to you and you have work to do engage with them in conversation for a few minutes
 
If you don’t want to talk to them the whole flight way to end it

Have a positive expression and tone
-          Well, it’s been great talking to you, I’ve promised myself I need to get some work done
-          Well, it’s been great talking to you

 
When the plane re-lands say goodbye
 
It takes more effort to undo a bad first impression than to make a good first impression
 
Be aware of the Halo effect
 
At the conference
-          As you walk into the conference for the first time shift your thinking on how you can make a positive impression on people around you
-          Don’t attend every event at a conference – you need downtime to re-charge

How to turn down invitations when you don’t want to go
-          Less is more
-          I’m going to go to bed early tonight


### Introverts & the job search ###
-          Be able to have a 30 second elevator pitch on what you do for work
-          Elevator pitches should be short
-          What you want to do is interest the people in what you do
-          Smile when you tell people your elevator pitch

 
#### System for creating a quality elevator pitch ####
-          Answer the following questions –
-          What do you do?
-          What do you want to do?
-          What sets you apart?
-          What inspires you about your work?
-          Put the top components together in a statement of up to ten sentences.

 
### Bring your A game ###
 
-          Use “As if” to set yourself in the mindset that the person you are talking to is the “right” person to talk to

 
#### Remembering Peoples Names ####
 
-          Know what type of preference you have for remembering things – Auditory, Visual, Kinaesthetic

 
Auditory
-          Use the name three times in initial conversation.
-          Ask how to spell it, then repeat if for confirmation
-          Clarify the pronunciation
-          Connect the name to his or her voice
-          Recall a song with the name, if possible
-          Say the name lyrically in your head

 
Visual
-          Envision the name written out
-          Make a visual image of the name
-          Look at the name tag
-          Link the name to what the person is wearing
-          Connect the name to the face
-          Picture a person you know with the same name

 
Kinaesthetic
-          Imagine the person engaged in an alliterated activity (Rick raking, Cathy cooking, etc).
-          Notice the person’s physical stance.
-          Notice the person’s mood and demeanour
-          Write down the name soon after talking
-          If seated in a group, draw a chart with the names
-          Draw the letters with your finger through the air… after moving away!


#### Networking for Introverts ####
-          Coordinated networking is useful for people that are introverts

 
### Coordinate Networking Activity Ideas ###
 
-          Place cards that describe people, place them on each table at each seating place – have people find place cards that best describe them
-          Name tag art – get people to draw some type of symbol that describes who they are
-          Musical greetings – play music, when the music stops, people stops walking and speak to the person next to them and discuss a topic called out, rinse repeat

 
Use name tags so that people can remember their name
 
##  Following up with people ##
 
Following up via email is preferable to following up via phone.
Make yourself concise and make yourself useful in the follow up
Follow up within 48 hours, don’t follow up on Monday’s though
The best day to ask for favour is Friday
Always thank people when they have done something
