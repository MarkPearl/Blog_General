How to interview software developers?

When you have a lot of applicants, you need a filter process. The problem with a filter process is that it misses outliers - brilliant people who do not meet the norm.

How do you filter people?

- Minimum CV requirements
- Technology experience
- Experience to do the job
- Any other indicator that removes that person from having a formal interview

What are you trying to establish when interviewing someone?

- Do they have the capacity to perform the work
- Do they communicate well
- How long will it take to ramp them up before they are able to actively contribute and add value
- Do they make a good cultural fit in the team (would they be able to work with others already in the team)
- Will they stay with the organization long enough for value to be realized

What does a candidate want from a postion?

- Will I learn and develop skills in the position
- Will I be treated well
- Will I be motivated and enjoy my work
- Will I be paid and rewarded fairly
- Will there be opportunity for progression within the organization

Current interview process:

- Candidate meets with Kevin to establish the person behind.
