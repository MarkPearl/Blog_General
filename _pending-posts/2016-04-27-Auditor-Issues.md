Hi team,
 
One of the teams I work with suffers from many interruptions by external and internal auditors (as often as monthly) and they have a few frustrations. 
 
I wondered if you could offer any good tips. Here are some of the issues:
External auditors have to change every five years, and seems the new ones need a lot more of the team's time because they don't understand enough yet.
Auditors walk up to individuals and will stand and wait until they get what they want. There isn't much advanced warning.
They want specific and detailed data from the database and don't want to be educated on the relationships in the database
They feel that they respond to the same queries in the same way and still get the same questions the next month
They feel that if they say "no, not now" the auditors will have concerns about what they might be hiding when in actual fact they are busy with important work.
Steps they are taking already:
Interacting with internal auditors when developing new requirements for business to ensure compliance.
Collecting data in a folder for questions they get most often.
I know in the past keyblade has spent some time trying to understand things a bit better and any suggestions are welcome!
 
Cheers,
