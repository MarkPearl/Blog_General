Whenever advocating change, it helps to understand the mindset of all the people who will be affected by that change. Because I have progressed to a software developer from a coding perspective, I often look at the creating of software from a programmers mindset. The challenge is, software is not just created by programmers, there are other people that add just as much value that are looking at the problem from a totally different angle. One of those is the Business Analyst.

What are some of the questions a BA has when involved in an agile project:

- What does it mean to have an agile mind-set as a BA? 
- Is the BA Role Agile?  
- What is the BAs Role in Agile Frameworks & Methodologies?  
- Where can the Agile BA add value to the value chain?  
- Where can the BA add value to the organisation that seeks to be agile in structure and approach? 

I have been on numerous “Agile Projects” as a BA and needless to say, the expectation from the BA role has been quite varied. 
The BA role in most agile settings is typically restricted to a “team member” status. What does it mean to be a team member?
