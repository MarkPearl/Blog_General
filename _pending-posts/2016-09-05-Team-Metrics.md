Assume that the people we are giving metrics to are not prics...

Quantitative data on how the team is improving
Progress tracking on delivery to give us a feel for when we will be done and how we can project future work
Impact of wasteful activities
 
I acknowledge that some teams are still learning how to track progress themselves and decided to include a brain dump of different types of metrics that I can think of (without debating the merit of each);

Performance
Delivery rate on estimate hours, story points or story counts (velocity)
Performance of actual delivery vs estimated delivery over time.
Delivery speed such as lead times, cycle times
Utilisation, capacity, etc.
Number of releases per day or week
Flow and Waste
“Value add" time vs "Non-value add time”
Wait time and Hand-offs
Task switching and interruptions
Day stories been blocked or not moving
Ad-hoc non-backlog work, meetings, etc.
Rate of unplanned work added to backlogs
Work in flight and queues
Defect rates / Change request rate
Support calls / incidents
General
Team / customer / product management happiness
NPS
Test coverage
Build success rate
Value
Impact on revenue by features
Cost of delay
NPS
Improvement
The effect of improvements on the above
Number of experiments per month
