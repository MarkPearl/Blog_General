#### General ####

Content is king, create the content, the design should work around the content.  

Aspects that should influence design:
- Audience (Age, Race, Gender, Cultural Niche)   
- Tone (Casual, Formal, Friendly, Sarcastic)   
- Purpose (Infromational, Conversational)  

#### Typography ####

##### Typeface Mixing #####

- Don't choose two fonts from the same style (e.g. two fonts that are both humanist serif).  
- Don't choose two fonts from the same class (e.g. two fonts that are both seri).  
- When mixing classes find a similar trait (e.g. using two fonts that share one thing in commong, but are otherwise different).  
- Strive for contrast over harmony.  

#### Leading ####

- Leading is the amount of space between lines.  
- Good leading is around 120-150% of the body copy size (e.g. line-height: 1.5)
