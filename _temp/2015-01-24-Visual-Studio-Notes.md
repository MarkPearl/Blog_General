#### Disabling File Preview on Solution Explorer Click ####


In Tools > Options > Environment > Tabs and Windows, you can disable it by unckecking "Solution explorer" under Preview tab.

I find it using the "Quick launch" new feature. Simply type "preview", and a link to the setting will be suggested.
